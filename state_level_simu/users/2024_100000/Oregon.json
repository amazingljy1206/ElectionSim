I don't think they ever intended to end Thope for good. They had many romantic scenes in March. The breakup was rushed but the writing also clearly established they love each other and always will.

Both are big failures.\n\u56de\u590d @Perfect_Ron_ @OU_angel_4ever Different contexts. Hope chose Wyatt because of manipulations/lies from Quinn. It was obvious she wasn't over Liam and would be jealous of Ivy. Right now she is pining for Thomas and seems over Liam. She didn't pick Thomas because of manipulations.  I Doubt she'll be jealous.\n\u56de\u590d @HawksianWoman @iheartjaxtara IMO, Finn doesn't have chemistry with anyone. His character is a total failure. I want Thope and Steam.\n\u56de\u590d @darevell54 @JR96043 A quick rebound if anything happens. Will be as short-lived as Steffy and Wyatt for instance. Finn is even more crazy than Thomas given how he defends his serial killer mother. And if he goes to Hope then he is as bad as cheating Liam. Hope won't want another waffling wuss.\n\u56de\u590d @KMe_ki I get it but well...... when you compare him to some other leading men like Rick Deacon Ridge, Bill or Eric, he is not that bad with women, isn't he? All he did was waffle between 2 women and kiss while married + the ons in 2020... These other men did  worse... way worse!\n\u56de\u590d @OU_angel_4ever Has Liam ever had scenes with Poppy? I seem to remember the show was insisting on the fact that Liam \"hasn't met Bill's new GF yet\". I think he is definitely a possibility. It would be a nice twist, imo.\n\u56de\u590d @sylviamarsh1 If it's Sheila manipulating for \"Hinn\", we already know she will fail. Forced couples never last. Even if something happens, it'll only be to facilitate Steam and create Thope angst.\n\u56de\u590d @iheartjaxtara @OU_angel_4ever Don't get me wrong, I'm very mad at Steffy rn. So many things I'm not liking about her lately, especially what she did to Thope of course. But I still like her more than Sheila and Finn and I'll always be a huge Steamer at heart. Ultimately I still want her free from Sheila/Finn\n\u56de\u590d @TealRealFeel @boldinsider \"never\" isn't exactly true. She said nearly 10 times that she loves and misses Thomas since he left her. I choose to believe her. And He is still mentionned in every episodes.\n\u56de\u590d @datvlover @AKendeck Finn hates Thomas and  Liam for no reason, this is what annoys me about him. I can see why Liam hates Thomas (Beth,...) and Finn (what happened with Kelly on the beach, Sheila,...) but Finn is just a giant hypocrite with his hate, when at the same time he's praising 9-toes.\n\u56de\u590d @_chickymonkey @JamaireRevis @MeemaSarah @LetsTalkSoaps Hi Angie, I hate Sinn but I admire your optimism. Don't give up on your ship. I love Thope and it makes me sad that so many fans are giving up on them so quickly. I want Steam back but I'm not convinced they are happening either. At least not this year.\n\u56de\u590d @TealRealFeel It worked with Wyatt, so why not this time again. He wanted Steffy to leave him because of Quinn, yet he knew  Quinn would still be in Steffy's life if she was with her grandfather Eric. Steffy knew it but still came back to him.\n\u56de\u590d @soaper410 Months? I doubt it. They can't help it when they're in the same room, the desire is too strong. Even if they decide to stay apart for some time, they'll be working together again and won't be able to resist.\n\u56de\u590d @TealRealFeel @boldinsider Now putting him with Hope would do permanent damages, I agree. Hope wasn't popular with Liam or Wyatt like she is with Thomas. Thomas had fans and was popular long before he got with Hope, so it's helping her character. Finn/Hope would be the kiss of death for B&amp;B\n\u56de\u590d @par67418 @iheartjaxtara You must have missed the dozens of scenes where Hope told Liam, Finn, Brooke, Steffy how much she  loves Thomas and how her life is unravelling since he left her. Are you deaf or blind?\n\u56de\u590d @Alex_Chatman @Alex_Chatman  How optimistic are you about Thope's future? I know you're one of their most positive fans (like I am,...). I haven't watched it yet (too nervous) but saw the pic of the kiss. What vibe are you getting? Who initiated it? I need a little dose of optimism please. :)\n\u56de\u590d @OU_angel_4ever Finn has been praising/hugging Hope and wrongly trashing Thomas for months now.Not only Finn should be held accountable, but he is looking way worse than Hope here. He is the married guy, Hope is single.\n\u56de\u590d @2Freelancer @TealRealFeel @boldinsider @BandB_CBS AN just said last week that Hope loves Thomas. Didn't you hear Hope say she never felt this way about anyone? No, it wasn't just sex. Thomas left her. She isn't cheating on anyone right now. They will be fine.\n\u56de\u590d @blkgrluso A triangle with Finn in the middle would kill this soap. I mean, he is Sheila's son. He called Sheila a hero, he loves her, he betrayed Steffy for her many times. She is a serial killer yet he keeps prioritizing her. No woman deserves to be saddled with a mommy's boy like him.\n\u56de\u590d @JadeJadebomber I like your positivism. I still believe in them too, I wish some of Thope fans wouldn't be so quick to jump to conclusions and tune out.\n\u56de\u590d @datvlover Yep, this is the first time there is close to zero support for a couple. Even Emma and Xander had more support, lol. The rare Hope/Finn shippers are Steam fans/ Thomas haters. It's not even about the couple, it's just agenda-shipping. They can't be more transparent.\n\u56de\u590d @KW_Jazz @Ohmydrama1 Either a tumor or a medical issue, maybe. But it's recent. She was happy with Thomas for 9 months and not showing one sign of headaches or dizziness. If she is going to have a tumor, it's very recent IMO. I'm not worried. This is Thope angst.\n\u56de\u590d @TealRealFeel We just need to stay optimistic. And be patient. Every couples overcome obstacles and get angst at some point.\n\u56de\u590d @pavyg @rolandgarros Is he playing Geneva or not?\nThis poll result should tell the writers everything they need to know.
