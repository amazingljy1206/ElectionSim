You said \u201ckeep up.\u201d As if I wasn\u2019t smart enough to know what\u2019s going on. At least that\u2019s how it was interpreted. And again, you use a personal attack to call me delusional. Instead of trying to prove me wrong. That\u2019s pretty rude, if you ask me.\n\u56de\u590d @PicturesFoIder I suffer from some severe mental illnesses. And as much as I\u2019ve tried to prevent outbreaks like this, unfortunately they do happen. Not really anymore but when I was younger\u2026 I\u2019d occasionally lose it.  There\u2019s absolutely no excuse for this behavior though. Mental illness or not.\n\u56de\u590d @libsoftiktok He probably thinks that as long as it\u2019s not his kids it\u2019s perfectly fine. Or heck, on the other hand, he could be trying to groom his kids to follow in his footsteps.\n\u56de\u590d @PAsHotMess @MindBodySoleUK \u2014 and get dozens of stitches and STAPLES on my head.  First thing my sister and sister in law said was \u201cHOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO YOUR NEICE AND NEPHEW?!!\u201d Never once did they ask if I was okay.  Idk. I love them all so much but that was really eye opening.\n\u56de\u590d @ask_aubry I know this comment is late but I\u2019m just now seeing this. It\u2019s infuriating that they say he was heartbroken and almost even blame the victim for being in a relationship. The way they word this article is disgusting.  And of course the crime is despicable.\n\u56de\u590d @CollinRugg Yeah\u2026 \u201cthey\u201d are doing fine but they keep aggressively whispering and cursing and they literally look like they\u2019re about to have a mental breakdown.  Well. At least Elon has what, 9 other kids? Lmfao.\n\u56de\u590d @KObjectivist @NotSolWalker @OliLondonTV Yeah the fat activists are crazy and I think they really ruined \u201cbody acceptance\u201d by taking things way too far. It turns away a lot of people when they\u2019re 300+ lbs and claiming that they are perfectly healthy. But yeah, people need to be inspired to lose the weight. Not shamed.\n\u56de\u590d @MamaJ1101 @ask_aubry If he cared so much about having sex, he would have been willing to help out with some of the household chores. Honestly if he did that she might be more willing to have sex.

I\u2019d want one to protect myself but so many other people want to hurt others.

And where will that money come from?  I think that reparations should be given to black communities as a whole and to schools and scholarships for black children. Not just a paycheck for individuals. But that\u2019s just me.\n\u56de\u590d @sawgraham @pietercleppe @gideonrachman The people I\u2019ve seen waving the American flag had no signs or flags to indicate which candidate they supported. They just wanted to show pride for their country.

So idk if it would work but man, sounds like it\u2019s gettting great results!\n\u56de\u590d @CollinRugg I don\u2019t think what Tim said was bad, honestly. Sounds like he was just saying that he wanted people who have gotten away with crimes to finally be held accountable. What Laura said though, was absolutely ridiculous and she basically screwed them both over with that comment.\n\u56de\u590d @folieaideux When Joker and Harley finally kiss I\u2019m low key going to want to punch her but I\u2019m also going to be so happy for them both.

Resorting to personal attacks because you have no other way to attack me or defend your statements. Keep it up. It really looks good for you.\n\u56de\u590d @Nyathera2 @DoomScroling Omg the manipulation and gaslighting is so real. Honestly the only reason I got out of it was because he ended it because he thought he had a better chance with other women. And in that moment it devastated me, but I quickly learned that it was the best thing for me.\n\u56de\u590d @CulinaryOasis79 @DeAngelisCorey That\u2019s the problem. These people have been indoctrinated in their schools that activism is the right thing to do but so many of them just follow what\u2019s popular or what their friends are doing. They don\u2019t learn the actual facts and then they go and block highways or occupy their\u2014\n\u56de\u590d @ClownWorld_ Sea world has been terrible for a long time. A LONG time. If you haven\u2019t seen the documentary called Blackfish yet I highly recommend that you do. They treat the animals like sh*t. It\u2019s truly awful how they get them from stealing them from the wild and then treat them awfully.\n\u56de\u590d @libsoftiktok @ShirionOrg Exactly. She should go to another country and criticize their government. See how well it goes for her. America is one of the only countries you can openly criticize without being punished. And our soldiers fought and died for that right. These people are so ungrateful.\n\u56de\u590d @_LI0n_King @Cayman_Fletch @whatever I actually agree with you there. I guess what I meant to say, instead of feel, is how I would think about a certain issue. It\u2019s very true that women use their feelings a lot more than men to decide how they will react. And that\u2019s why we need men to keep us grounded. But women\u2014\n\u56de\u590d @raidragon1234 @DelusionPosting Yeah she doesn\u2019t look 12 at all. She definitely has a \u201cchildlike face\u201d but her body clearly shows that she\u2019s well developed. Not sure why anyone would call someone a pedo for liking her picture.\n\u56de\u590d @nino4rmtheO @Theo_OOTRR @RealEmirHan His performance in this movie is beyond phenomenal. It\u2019s because of this movie that I started looking into his other ones. But I truly love the character of Arthur Fleck. He\u2019s a guy that tries to do everything right and gets shut down at every turn.\n\u56de\u590d @beyondtiltbro @Cobratate Good morning to you as well. Why did you tag me in this?
