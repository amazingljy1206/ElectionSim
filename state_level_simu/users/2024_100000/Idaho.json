Deliveries to Jersey, Providence, Hartford, Philly and Boston are still on.Did anyone consider that even a small number of non MAGA truckers could seize this opportunity to make premium cash ferrying these loads into the city?\n\u56de\u590d @krassenstein Better to use the photo where he mocked the disabled reporter.  Lots of leaders are fat, old and out of shape. (Admittedly not many are painted orange).   But the photo of him mocking the reporter should be what we think of when we hear his name.   The mug shot would also work.\n\u56de\u590d @Ann_Lilyflower Totally agree.  I\u2019ve been reading a lot about the crisis in evangelical churches.  Most youth pastors have been arrested for sexual assault of children. (Google \u201cyouth pastor arrested\u201d).  These low lifes need permanent prison scentences.\n\u56de\u590d @JakeLangJ6 Bullshit!!  Fox has repeatedly stated that the \u201criot\u201d was infiltrated by Antifa and its members were amongst the most aggressive!!  This guy is probably an Antifa operative who is now looking for MAGA members to bail him out!\n\u56de\u590d @Don_COi @lawofruby And for the white trash  MAGAts ,   Unfortunately none of this matters.   They\u2019ve hated blacks for so long that they would vote for a known traitor if it meant they could remain open racists rather then retreat back to the shadows.\n\u56de\u590d @KTHopkins Kids are safe at the Olympics as long as they are not approached by Evangelical youth pastors.  Please Google \u201cyouth pastor arrested\u201d.  The list is way too long for anyone to deny this is some organized pedo cult.\n\u56de\u590d @Draintheswamp96 @j6prayingrandma I\u2019m sorry,  but her prison sentence is the will of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.     As we do not understand his ways,  it is not up to us to judge or criticize the lawmen and judges that imposed this sentence.  It is the way it must be.\n\u56de\u590d @AA2ANJ @CallahanAutoCo So you\u2019re still technically in the New York Metropolitan area.\n\u56de\u590d @AnnaMargaretAp1 She was breaking in.  He was standing his ground   Simple as that.    If you support standing your ground laws,  you must agree it was justified.  If you\u2019re a snowflake and don\u2019t believe a gun owner can shoot an attacker ,  well then you might as well just hand over your money.\n\u56de\u590d @TLF5foot8 @ybarrap @j6prayingrandma What church is that?   They are obviously cool with pussy grabbing, serial infidelity and paying porn stars for sex.  I\u2019m looking for a new denomination that is a bit more exciting than my previous one. MAGA morals might bring some spice to church brunches and dinners.\n\u56de\u590d @MaddyJean19 @dom_lucre Dude makes fun of and mocks a crippled reporter and y\u2019all cool with that.  Harris says she worked at a McDonald\u2019s and y\u2019all go ballistic.   Not judging,  just making an observation\n\u56de\u590d @tippmajor Thanks for this Tipp\u2026.. this is way more fun than most Twitter debates.  Even the one about music end up getting political.   And for the record,  I was never an Eli fan (Patriots fanboy),  but he absolutely deserves to get in.   So does Big Ben.  Philip Rivers - no\n\u56de\u590d @lalalainsd @ShadowofEzra He did not close churches .  Ukraine is a much more religious country than America and furthermore there is no epidemic of church pastors abusing small kids like there is in American evangelical churches,  so the priests and pastors there are not hypocritical opportunists like US\n\u56de\u590d @FPWellman He and Harris are running against a sex predator  who stole top secret documents and left them in his bathroom, refused to return them and the FBI had to get them back.  He has also been convicted of fraud and has stolen from a kids cancer charity.    Who cares about Walz\u2019 rank!!\n\u56de\u590d @glennkirschner2 What upsets DT more than any of this are the unflattering court room photos and the documented farting. The evangelicals are somehow comfortable with the infidelity, the financial crimes and the lies, and will forgive him.  It\u2019s hard to vote for a man who shits his pants in court\n\u56de\u590d @jasrifootball I miss old school football.  I stopped watching college because of all those 70-63 games.

The three main Canadian news providers have ALWAYS been somewhere left of centre.  CBC, globe and mail and the Toronto Star.  I also think Evangelicals are whack jobs.  But you lose credibility when you over react like this. Serves no purpose\n\u56de\u590d @ParodyAoc @SWinstonWolkoff The cheating is one thing. When added to his stealing of secret documents, his knee bending fealty to Putin, stealing from a kids cancer charity, gross violation of emoluments clause, childish bullying, inciting a riot and pathologic narcissism,  it says a lot about his character\n\u56de\u590d @JohnnyTabacco This only makes sense if the assassination was intended to fail and produce fantastic photo ops.

Trump Derangement Syndrome pushed a lot of former liberals towards literal communism (people like Destiny creating the grift that is lefty debate bro culture didn't helped).  So it's going to take a while to the Left fix themselves.\n\u56de\u590d @kekolds @sleepy_devo @TheGatorGamer But if you ask me, this will either end with Gator settling the issue and not talking about this ever again where everyone moves on from this or this escalates unnecessarily and we get a repeat of the Mr. Enter drama where no one wins.\n\u56de\u590d @TheGatorGamer Advertisers generally don't like advertising stuff next to content that can see as subjectively offensive (porn, hate speech, 9/11 conspiracy theories) so they often ask social media platforms to scrub away stuff that they can feel comfortable advertising on said platforms.\n\u56de\u590d @OliverJia1014 Depends on who will be their leader this year. I don't think a moderate like Kishida is going be the LDP's leader this time around (no one in Japan likes him and he is sinking in the approval ratings) so chances are they will replace him with some staunch Abe-type conservative.\n\u56de\u590d @TheYcOrg @MentisWave @praxben Your average libertarian is in favor of things like recreational drug decriminalization and also allowing more individual freedoms for groups such as the LGBT community.  Your average boomercon like Andrew Torba doesn't want any of that because he can't bully people in the NAP.\n\u56de\u590d @MoshiMoshiMoan So far what we know is that the perpetrator used to be progressive, it seems they made the switch to right wing politics sometime in 2022 when they dropped out of a progressive mailing list, and then they registered as Republican.  Also they wore a Demolition Ranch shirt.\n\u56de\u590d @ReviewsPossum Communists would downplay anything to make their horrible ideology not look bad lol.\n\u56de\u590d @crash_matrix @not__vee It seems like Trump wants to take the GOP into a Big Tent or at least a more Libertarian direction.  After seeing the RNC so far, it seems Trump realized the the GOP needs rebranding to attract the young secular voters. The old boomer evangelicals aren't going to cut it anymore.\n\u56de\u590d @NobleAtlas88 It's a repeat of Kurt Eichenwald.  Vaush tried to \"Own the Right\" and he ended up showing off his porn collection in the process.  I'm sure any veteran of the culture wars may remember the time Kurt Eichenwald having a tab open for a milf hentai doujin in a screenshot lol.\n\u56de\u590d @DrInsensitive @Sargon_of_Akkad Probably the most objective way to achieve a sound moral fabric for society is time preferences.  No religion needed and time preferences takes a much more objective approach for someone to not find themselves in self-destructive behavior.\n\u56de\u590d @KirscheVerstahl No offense but I'd avoid Sargon of Akkad and his crew.        DEI/BRIDGE is cringe but you should not get yourself involved with that guy or let alone promote his content.        Trust me, you don't want to be involved with these guys knowing Sargon's track record.\n\u56de\u590d @OliverJia1014 A lot of the big name historical libertarians supported Israel as well, this isn't anything new.  Ayn Rand is one of them despite her being popular among right-wing circles.\n\u56de\u590d @Grxit Let's be honest here. The only reasons why Twitch and Facebook have unbanned Trump is to simply get on his good side assuming he wins.  They want to keep Section 230 intact and lobby away any potential proposals that could pose a threat to their business models, nothing more.\nYou're a morbidly obese neckbeard that's on the sex offender registry where you fled America and moved to Mexico to escape your legal troubles.  You're in no position to lecture anyone about morality. https://t.co/AIvlkDSmKH\n\u56de\u590d @MoshiMoshiMoan The FBI is still looking for a motive but based on what is public so far, it seems the perpetrator had a similar story like Baked Alaska (where BA used to be a progressive but turned to the Right later on).  In this case, the perpetrator went down a very dark path.\n\u56de\u590d @AlexanderGRubi2 @NobleAtlas88 Then you really don't know Jim.  Yeah, Jim does rip on the Online Left (people like Vaush comes to mind) but he's no stranger in making fun of the Online Right as well (Nick Fuentes and Sargon of Akkad).  You're under the false assumption that Jim takes any side in politics then.\n\u56de\u590d @GodMatters1st @Grxit Torba is a lolcow because he identifies with Christian Nationalism but is unable to understand that Trump is an evangelical, not a religious nationalist which is why Trump is cool with Israel and the Jews.  Furthermore, Torba is a poor steward for the privacy of his users on Gab.\n\u56de\u590d @LookAtMyMeat1 Also, I have no clue what he is talking about since Japanese entertainment is no stranger to Christianity.  A Certain Magical Index and those old Bible themed anime from the 80's and 90's (Superbook, The Flying House, and In the Beginning: The Bible Stories) exists.\n\u56de\u590d @OliverJia1014 I'm sure third-party companies will pop up to keep hardware like the PSP to still stay alive (they still make aftermarket parts to replace parts such as the infamous 32-pin connector for the NES where the original connector is garbage).  But yeah, the PSP is such a pain to fix.\n\u56de\u590d @YOG3NSHA Probably the reason why I don't think anime and manga will ever be fully subverted anytime soon by those from overseas.  To the majority of normies, it's not really \"safe edgy\" and can be seen an subjectively weird.  Japanese content gatekeeps itself.\n\u56de\u590d @DrInsensitive @Sargon_of_Akkad But you also forget why the Left wins. They made the wise choice to invest in young people; something that the Right has failed to do time and time again.  I see ideologies like I see an investment; the Left is like Amazon and the Right is like Sears.\n\u56de\u590d @BackupS19947 @DemonicDgen @Grxit You're defending a lolcow in the making.  I will laugh when the day comes that LibsofTiktok will do something so stupid that even the other right-wingers cannot defend her.  Mark my words, you guys are making a huge mistake.\n\u56de\u590d @bigtiredboy @LilithLovett If this does become law (God forbid) then I imagine that it's not going to do so well in the federal court system.   The biggest issue with this bill is that it's subjectively written in a way that gives state attorney generals to censor information for minors.\n\u56de\u590d @piromysl @MentisWave I'll admit, I find the whole loli thing to be really weird.  The only reason why I defend it is for the same reasons why I defend hate speech and 1990's Yugoslav wartime music because I do it for the sake of free speech.\n\u56de\u590d @idk_600z @OliverJia1014 So in the case of the Israel-Hamas conflict and the recent incident in Yemen, only the Jews and white people can be the \"villain\" while the Arab insurgent groups are the \"good guys\" under communist logic.  It's not really a bug that communists are insane bigots, it's a feature.\n\u56de\u590d @AzertWarrior @Grxit So far Lava (the alleged victim) announced that they were not groomed by Kris and claims that the videos covering the drama is lies and misinformation.   So Kris and the rest of the Mr. Beast crew do now have an incentive to lash out at these people.\n\u56de\u590d @wicked_ninja123 @Grxit I don't know, other news agencies are really floating the idea that this could happen.
