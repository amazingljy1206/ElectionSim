He just doesn't stop. No idea when to stop. He's desperate to find anything negative to say about #34. This is the most bizarre thing he's seen in his life...LOL...he's analytically pathetic, Justin!!\n\u56de\u590d @dalter Don't usually watch the media availability. I did tonight.

Keep up the good work, J.T. Playoffs are going to rock!!\n\u56de\u590d @theScore They're working up the nerve to approach him and tell him they want to trade him.

The privilege of being invited into others lives to bear witness and watch healing is like a gift. Truly.\n\u56de\u590d @tracesoffaith With the excommunications and defrocking of priests it makes it even harder since a conservative parish will lose their priest or bishop. A mass is still a mass, whether it is said in Latin or English, so all still have access to weekly service and communion.\n\u56de\u590d @WindandHoney @JustAmyZing @thesaltedtable @BethMooreLPM 4!!\n\u56de\u590d @snowgirlcheryl @BethMooreLPM @MarthaNamie A doctor said this to you?!?!? I swear some of them need whole year classes on treating patient with kindness and empathy. I asked my eye dr yesterday who I should call if I had an emergency later (I\u2019m allergic to meds and had just been administered one). He said *dont call me*\n\u56de\u590d @tpusafaith @conservmillen I have to disagree. Empathy isn't sympathy, it is the ability to deeply understand what someone else is going through because they are standing in their shoes. Empathy is a combination of two Greek words, \u201cem\u201d and \u201cpathos,\u201d which together mean \u201cin feeling.\"..\n\u56de\u590d @Andy35o I was once introduced to a pastor and he asked me what I did for a living. I told him I was a psychologist. Without a beat he replied *I'm sorry to hear it*. My friend said I should have told him I do counseling, psychology has a bad rap in Eva  circles...\n\u56de\u590d @cheryl_deniece @BethMooreLPM Cheryl my sister has a Golden who is extremely protective of my 92 year old mom. When they are home alone Bailey will come to her bedroom door, stare at her and then take leave. Checking on her till they get home. They know!\n\u56de\u590d @TheSassyBirdie We spent the day at the lake with family. Arrived home after 9 to all of the neighbors shooting off rockets in their backyards straight into the air.

I don\u2019t know.. uhm.. not sure we\u2026* *HEY! COME BACK HERE*\n\u56de\u590d @tracesoffaith Very hard on my friends in the church. Especially if they can't find a parish that fits their beliefs. Most of those bite their tongues and go to weekly mass but do not follow the pope's teachings. They vote as they see fit, and pattern their lives according to their belief..\n\u56de\u590d @WindandHoney @BethMooreLPM Changed the rest of my life . I think too, his. AT 81 he was coming to my home for bible study (another miracle lol). One night leaving he asked me about salvation.

I wasn\u2019t pretty. I was snark with a capital S. To the point of entering a chat room once and one of my *enemies* (an orthodox priest no less) said *there goes the neighborhood*\u2026\nNo we didnt feel an earthquake.. this time..\n\u56de\u590d @MidniteOil55 Always loved that pic. Was sad to hear she passed away\n\u56de\u590d @drewdyck Wait, are you guys in Canada???\n\u56de\u590d @tracesoffaith To me I see a schism within the current church, although unlike a Protestant church which would split, Catholics don\u2019t leave but rather find a parish where their beliefs are upheld. Within Catholicism there is the SSPX, which comes under the pope, but celebrates the Latin mass..\n\u56de\u590d @pi3sugarpi3 @PastorBenMarsh This is why I got married in FEBRUARY. Big white gown.. add nerves, recipe for death. Thankfully we didn't have a blizzard.

Before approaching the church. Or the school. Call childline.\n\u56de\u590d @JustAmyZing @BethMooreLPM Amy I did not know you suffered like this in church.  I'm so sad to hear it.

What I've been arguing is that the protection that men do is for the group, and that includes other men.\n\u56de\u590d @Kevinverted @toweypat @men_are_human @Stoicsense2 \"Man\" cannot be something that doesnt exist (gender). Gender was coined as the socialized obverse of sex 1945.  That doesnt exist, that doesnt happen. Masculinity Femininity are heavility influenced by sexual selection an genes AND culture AND enviroment.  https://t.co/UgHF8mxuei https://t.co/IFqFweYFaz\n\u56de\u590d @EtfNot @DanielKrawisz @Devon_Eriksen_ Social gynocentrism is a reality. Biological, not so much.  What Im arguing is that the whole \"protect women\" is a partial truth hiding the fact that for sexual selection purposes, the goal is to spread the genome. And for that the group is more important than women.\n\u56de\u590d @TheInvi80692073 @Androphillia I understand what you're trying to convey. But do you persuade people by accepting and actively spreading their ideas?  I just dont see how spreading false information and propaganda that criminalizes men could be persuasive or helpful.\n\u56de\u590d @EtfNot @DanielKrawisz @Devon_Eriksen_ Oh and to round it up. If you understand that having men in your group is as important as having women, you understand that the protection function of males, in our species, is directed to protect THE GROUP, not the females specially.\n\u56de\u590d @EtfNot @DanielKrawisz @Devon_Eriksen_ I watched the video, but only a few minutes were central to our conversation.  I thought we were arguing if gynocentrism was biological or not.  What I argue, and the article does much better than I do, is that it is not. Gynocentrism is cultural.\n\u56de\u590d @Michael_B_1970 Reproduction is just one component of the chain that ensures genome propagation. Human are an example of very low reproduction rates and to compensate we have a HUGE rate of survivability provided mainly by males.\n\u56de\u590d @CarlBoylin @JaniceFiamengo 0% of them were investigated by the judge, even tho both the DA and the judge are compelled by law to initiate the process, they didnt.  It's true that those courts only process severe crimes, but there is no reason tu assume that the other courts behave differently.\n\u56de\u590d @DeboraMontesoro @MalePsychology @jeffmil05137595 Why does the title imply that supporting male victims is an act of violence against women?  Its the second time I see something similar done with UK official documents. https://t.co/XrYiAswtCc\n\u56de\u590d @EtfNot @DanielKrawisz @Devon_Eriksen_ This is what happened:  I said \"men are the limiting factor for survival\". And instead of contesting that principle, you made up a fucking retarded scenario where that's not the case.  Like I said before, im not interested in your made up scenarios. I only care about principles. https://t.co/JU5SlSZhe6\n\u56de\u590d @mensrightsbunny Spain has pardoned several women that kidnaped and abused their children, abusing aswell the husbands. Spain has, by law (inescapable), harsher punishments for men than for women for the exact same crime.  I would argue that Spain is the most misandric, feminist country right now\n\u56de\u590d @EtfNot @DanielKrawisz @Devon_Eriksen_ So you don't think the species is gynocentric But you think that the material conditions made it so it was the reproduction step in the spreading the genome that was mostly challenged throught human history, so that required the \"gynocentric\" approach of protecting women over men\n\u56de\u590d @EtfNot @DanielKrawisz @Devon_Eriksen_ more important than men for the homo sapiens species, or that they were in the past, knowing the theory came from a biased source with a deranged notion of superiority, should make you revise the arguments.\n\u56de\u590d @Gynocentrism Is to ask them if males and females in our species have traits, selected through sexual selection, to enhance the survival of the offspring/children. When they agree to that (neoteny helps), they can start to let go the idea that the protection instincts of men are only for women\n\u56de\u590d @eyeslasho We need to normalize the ostracism for stupid people that have failed themselves and have failed humanity by not acquiring this basic knowledge. People that think that its all culture, that humans are a blank slate, no diff between men and women.  We have to purge those ideas.\n\u56de\u590d Game of thrones, The bear and the maiden fair.  \ud83c\udfb6Oh, I'm a maid, and I'm pure and fair! I'll never dance with a hairy bear! I called a knight, but you're a bear! All black and brown and covered in hair!\ud83c\udfb6 https://t.co/raei60eWSG\n\u56de\u590d @Morfran1 @MattWalshBlog @Oneiorosgrip You have to adapt to the circunstances of today.  But that shouldnt stop us from asking that men are treated like humans and/or compensated for the horrors they face as soldiers for example.\n\u56de\u590d But then he says that Adam was foolish for eating inmediatly.   He also says that Eve ate first because she was a little more corageous than him.  And then he starts ranting on Adam as a sad creature for avoiding responsability!!\n\u56de\u590d @triggerwarnung @MalePsychology To pass the genome there are 2 main factors: reproduction and survivability. And men are crucial for the second. Even men that didnt reproduce were crucial for the succesful offspring of those who did.\n\u56de\u590d @_BRCooper @Rothmus There is another possibility that I have experienced: they're too scared of sounding \"prejudiced\" if they dont counter or add some nuances to the generalization.  Truly horrible people.\n\u56de\u590d @Arduino_jantje @PhilMitchell83 The second phrase is even worse, because women perpetrate much more domestic violence than men. But Im 200% sure they didnt include threats of false allegations, false allegations, parental alienation or parental abduction.\n\u56de\u590d So if we believe that masculinity and femininity are based on nothing, that they are social constructs SEPARATED from sex, we would be wrong.
