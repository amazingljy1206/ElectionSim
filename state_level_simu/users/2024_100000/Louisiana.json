Maybe black powder pistols and abomination forms of AR pistols are gtg. Unless it is a list where all criteria need to be met but I doubt it.  This is why we talk crap to those that know nothing about guns\n\u56de\u590d @bmitori For me, what I found to be far more important than which part of your fingertip is on the trigger is obviously the straight back pull of the finger. Further, with handguns, i realized it was less placement and more about not gripping with the other fingertips of the firing hand\nSaw an article that said mortgage rates have dropped to the lowest since April 2023. 6.44% wow great, fantastic.

Has probably never even tried a dot on a handgun nor shotgun.\n\u56de\u590d @BenMadison20 @HardPass4 Ive never bought from PSA but I will say that its likely that a good amount of people buying PSA to have a rifle on hand for low cost don't have the necessary armorers tools to fix loose barrel or castle nuts unfortunately.   QA &amp; QC does cost extra money tho, so probs unlikely\n\u56de\u590d @RenoMayGuns This is what congressman cicilline meant when he said braces turn an ar pistol into a bumpstock\n\u56de\u590d @BDBSoCal @MorosKostas @2Aupdates @AGRobBonta @GavinNewsom They mention straw purchasing but let's be real. You don't need to do buy multiple at once for that. Arms dealing is their only (kinda) logical explanation but like a judge asked, aren't arms dealers buying in bulk? Not 2 or 3 at a time? Still dealing w registration like you said\n\u56de\u590d @mysteriouskat I mean I'm sure her martial arts skills are better than using this.

Big yikes\n\u56de\u590d @RenoMayGuns Did they confirm the cartridge yet?   Let's also not forget that the dude probably never practiced shooting down at a target, which typically throws people off.   The people who are actually saying it's staged have no concept of the difficulty level of a shot like that.\n\u56de\u590d @hundreth_the @Markle2k @JVGIndyVoter @StevenTDennis So you are suggesting that either we shouldn't even bother regulating machine guns in this country bc it doesn't matter? Or, we should have adequate means to fight tyrannical govts? Pretty sure both us and Russia have been smacked around for decades fighting \"inferior\" armies...\n\u56de\u590d @TBifford I'm just trying to figure out why they all pied but failed to cut all the way and attempt to split the door. Halfway cleared from outside, some were literally putting their barrel in the doorway even after dude in front got tagged. Nade would be ideal\n\u56de\u590d @JCarrollFoy Ew just shut up.  Guns are pretty regulated. Have you even bought one before?  You think taking away guns are going to stop the 13 yr olds murdering each other? No they would just use a different tool.

During slavery in Latin America, brown men were put in charge of black men so they feel superior. They are worse than whites supremacy.\n\u56de\u590d @WallStreetSilv What happened is that those who were outcasts in the West, fat people, Black people, LGBTQ people, women, etc worked on getting into positions of power thru DEI and all they wanted was to destroy the establishment that excluded them.\n\u56de\u590d @lporiginalg When I moved to Ottawa 5 years ago it was a peaceful city.

The level of hate people have for them for their actions is extending to the rest of us. We need to do something about them.\n\u56de\u590d @badlibtakes I\u2019ll give my two cents on that as an immigrant myself. Whether legal or illegal, we\u2019re looked at as the same by the general public. You can be a millionaire from Mexico, you\u2019ll never be accepted by Americans. A Norwegian can be homeless, they\u2019ll still get more respect than us.\n\u56de\u590d @ScienceGuys_ I would celebrate it. We don\u2019t deserve this planet.

He said the West, particularly North America, would be the same as Latin America, people mixing, big governments, low culture, and that would lead to western downfall of the Germans lost the war.\n\u56de\u590d @OgbeniDemola This is because Black culture is a failure across the planet, even in the wealthiest countries in the world, so we look for other forms of belonging. Sometimes it\u2019s religion, sometimes it\u2019s nationality like black Americans are now denying their blackness and embracing Americanism\n\u56de\u590d @stillgray Only in America can you see that. The sense of entitlement of Black women is incomparable. They have been put on a pedestal as the biggest victims on the planet so that\u2019s where their entitlement comes from but most end up alone or in situationships with \u201chood\u201d men.\n\u56de\u590d @Katheri22085288 When I tell people how much Canada is starting to resemble countries like Brazil and Argentina people laugh it off. Just give it another decade or two of mass immigration and leftists in power and you\u2019ll see.\n\u56de\u590d @patriota_MNi @ShitpostGate Brazil is more German. Most of the millionaires and billionaires of Brazil have German ancestry. They have built great German towns in Brazil and they run the car, beer, food, tech industry among others.\n\u56de\u590d @lvng4excellence @DelusionPosting Men are so desperate these days, specially immigrants, that women have an endless pool of middle to low value men to pick from at any age.\n\u56de\u590d @PrepAccordingly @RadioGenoa I think that\u2019ll be good but the retaliation against people of European descent outside of the first world (Brazil, Argentina, South Africa, etc) will be hardcore. You\u2019ll have to take them in a refugees if you want to save white people. Even here in Canada, many whites will suffer\n\u56de\u590d @pearlythingz Women. I became increasingly frustrated with the fact that we both men and women were taught to save ourselves and pray but women would jump at the first guy who came from the streets as a new convert. They wanted experience, they didn\u2019t want a man to build with from scratch.\n\u56de\u590d @pearlythingz She could Airbnb the second bedroom and make that money back. Or get a roommate.
