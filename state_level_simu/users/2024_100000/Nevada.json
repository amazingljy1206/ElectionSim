Correct me if I\u2019m wrong but it was overturned during YOUR term?!   Never have I seen a president lie and misconstrue more than I have ever seen in my lifetime.\nThis is exactly why we need a new administration!

It\u2019s not sustainable and neither is Harris.\n\u56de\u590d @PaulTassi This is probably a me thing but I absolutely despise hero based games.

I will add that I intend to vote trump for 2024\n\u56de\u590d @JoeBiden Oh you mean the rigged election that got you in office?  Or are you referring to this years election that's even more rigged once you allow illegal immigrants to vote in a country they're not even a citizen in? Our country is falling apart thanks to you and your administration...\n\u56de\u590d @jaybirdsatx @SarahHuckabee Oh you mean our crippled economy where over 60% of American citizens are living paycheck to paycheck?

Our government prioritizes other countries over its own citizens\u2026 what a joke\u2026\n\u56de\u590d @nicksortor Sure lets just keep letting more undocumented immigrants into the country so more crimes can occur to cover up the biggest scandal in US history.
