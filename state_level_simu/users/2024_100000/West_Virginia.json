It's people who claim \"all men are rapists/potential rapists\" or support collective punishment for men, dismiss female-on-male abuse or actively act as apologists for it, those are misandrists.\n\u56de\u590d I'm referring to this blatant piece of patronising garbage that flies in the face of what the founder if #MeToo originally said.  https://t.co/8kanFOLQAw\n\u56de\u590d @GayleWashburn @antifemwife And the source is the \"enliven project\" that's not exactly known for acknowledgement of female-on-male abuse. What a joke \ud83e\udd23\nNote that this post also selects only examples of male-on-male abuse survivors to credit #MeToo for supporting male survivors. Nothing on Asia Argento and Jimmy Bennett. Why is that I wonder? Because #MeToo left him to rot?\nRatfems and redpillers are two sides of the same coibln. What makes redpillers interesting, though, is that they carry the hallmarks of how extremists work. \"You've been discarded/traumatised, join me, and I'll solve your problems.\" Young traumatised men, including abuse victims,\u2026\nNot \"a teacher had sex with two boys\", it's \"a woman working as a teacher RAPED two underage boys\" so get it right @BBCNews https://t.co/56SYGIG0em\n\u56de\u590d @LisaBritton @FemCondition 3) I'd also say that better forms and methods of education aimed at their strengths and working with their weaknesses will also help.
