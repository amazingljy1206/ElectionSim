As lots of other minorities have pointed out, constantly being asked to explain bigotry is tiring. There are experts on these things and people who represent widely held views, instead of just one person's. Just Google it.\nTonight, my 16-year-old and I watched the 1947 Oscar Best Picture, Gentleman's Agreement, where Gregory Peck plays a reporter who goes undercover as a Jew to experience antisemitism.

And because of its religious significance, I dislike it being used as a prop even more.\n\u56de\u590d @TaliaRinger In Canada, where we have never had SATs, they just had a different set of unofficial admission averages.

I hate thinking these pictures discourage people from donating or advocating for more aid for Gaza.

(1) The need is tremendous (2) public pressure from the West could probably do more to change this situation than it could ceasefire negotiations.\n\u56de\u590d What would be great: more small-medium sized grocery stores and medical offices.

The difference is that Trump didn't commit a crime. The court, or the judge still haven't said what the felony is in the Trump case. If you know what it is, please let us. What crime did Trump commit? That is a felony under our constitution or NY state law?\n\u56de\u590d @JustCalmNsense @SUBRATA30016572 Other than allowing a Justice who cannot define what a woman is on the highest court not all that much has changed. Social Media just blows everything out of proportion and out of context. People have lives outside of politics\nThis influencer is out of material. He's making a comparison to drag queens &amp; people that wear make up for TV performances &amp; photos. That's a stretch. Just about everyone on TV will wear makeup for appearance. Very different things from People hiding their biological gender.\nAntifa is a gang paid by the likes of George Soros &amp; other Marxist / communist organizations. Their goal is to divide Americans &amp; conquer our country from within. If you want to lose the Bill of Rights &amp; all of the freedoms we have under our constitution, then you like ANTIFA!\n\u56de\u590d @mmpadellan Mr. influencer. It is called freedom of speech. Just like I don't care for some of the things that you post I will still support my first amendment right &amp; yours. You have the right to your opinion. So does Mr. Vance. Some people seem to think freedom of speech is just for them\n\u56de\u590d @mmpadellan Americans believe that Biden's corrupt DOJ has set up Trump w/  False accusations &amp; are guilty of election interference. #1 example is the Hunter Biden laptop. All of the sudden it's real and it's being used as evidence. The justice system is corrupt. Biden will lose in November\n\u56de\u590d @_wake_up_USA Who the Hell is Jill Biden? Being the Presidents wife does not make her an expert on politics or what it takes to build a system for education or anything else. Don't let Democrats make her a political figure.\nDeNiro is a washed up actor. Trump will be the 47th President\n\u56de\u590d @mmpadellan The 2020 election was obviously rigged. Any party that wants to eliminate voter ID and relax the rules on voter registration wants to do so for a no good reason. It's hilarious that the party that has been accused of cheating wants to change the rules to make cheating easier.\nWait-and-see. So far Trump has not made any mistakes. I believe in our democracy and I believe this will get to a court that will eventually make things right. Crooked ass politics and court systems cannot be allowed to take over America.\nAgain, we are paying for the nasty comments back-and-forth between the women in Congress last week. This is a waste of government taxpayer money. They're all guilty. It does not matter that MTG started it. It would've been graceful had someone taken the highroad\n\u56de\u590d @harryjsisson All garbage. Tell me what Biden policies are working. America knows that Biden has not been successful in either foreign or domestic politics.\nI choose not to live in a sanctuary city. Why should my tax dollars go to the aid of a sanctuary city? If you like sanctuary cities, then you live there and you pay taxes there\nBiden had 3 YRSto declassify the Epstein case &amp; he didn't . Why? It is a sure thing that he wouldn't be re-elected if he did. There were so many powerful people &amp; Politicians associated w/Epstein that whoever exposes this would be finished politically. 1st you must get elected\nJeffries is a Socialist. You only want Jeffries if you want Americans to give up their Bill of Rights. I think that all races and all legal immigrants come to the USA because they want that Bill of rights &amp; they want to live Free. Trump will uphold the Constitution!

Trump is going to be President in November\n\u56de\u590d @mmpadellan @ReallyAmerican1 I'm sick &amp; tired of the crimes that have been committed by people that have crossed our border. They are being set free without bail. They continue to commit murder, smother, drugs, and squat in our homes. You should be sick of this too. Joe Biden cannot fix this. Trump will.\nWomen who support Trump are those that don't want to see their daughters participating in sports against biologically born males. These women don't want their children, subject to critical race theory in schools. These women do not want R or X-rated literature in schools.\n\u56de\u590d @harryjsisson Is that the only thing that Biden will be good for is to pick a Democrat for the Supreme Court? I guess that's why you're panicking. Biden has nothing else to run on. By the way, Clarence Thomas is just fine. He does not need to retire until he is as old as old as Biden\nYou forget we all the people voted for Obama both times he was elected. Its not a race thing. I voted for Obama. I am not voting Democrat this time because I don't think that Democrats Policies are working in today's world. We cannot take more of the same. The left needs a reset\n\u56de\u590d @harryjsisson Dream On! The Biden Administration is over. The nightmare ends in November\nTrump is the 1st choice for America. Democrats allowed Biden, while suffering from dementia &amp; w/clearly declining cognitive skills to be President of our country for the past 3 1/2 years. Then they lied about it &amp;  manipulated the media to lie. We can't trust Democrats right now.\n\u56de\u590d @MayoIsSpicyy I can't afford to keep living at the rate of Biden's inflated economy. Go to the grocery store and try and cook a meal for a family of five for under $50. It's nearly impossible. Just one meal\n\u56de\u590d @elonmuskADO Yes\nAnswer, everyone in the country including prominent Democrat Leaders in the house &amp; senate are busy worrying about what to do about the Incumbent President Biden's cognitive decline. Wake up people the Government is falling down around Biden. Who is running the country? Jill?\n\u56de\u590d @mmpadellan REMINDER this is a paid influencer with a mission to slander Biden's opposition candidates. His job is to lie &amp; cheat in anyway possible to provide advantages to the Democrats Socialist Agenda.\n\u56de\u590d @mmpadellan American knows that Dr. Fauci invested in the laboratory that developed COVID-19. America knows that Fauci did nothing but lie about Covid. Fauci lied and people died. Stop blaming the Republican party. Donald Trump was a great president and will be one again in 2024.\nHarry, you have less Americans following you every day. Nobody believes in the Obama experiment. Your president has failed. Obama has failed. The country wants change.\nGuilty of what? They don't have a legitimate case of anything illegal. This should've never went to court.

You have never said a good word or encouraged a Democrat.\n\u56de\u590d @Damaan4u33 Yes I trust Jack Smith.  GOD bless Jack Smith. I stand with GOD and right, no matter which side it comes from. Trump is a manipulator and a criminal. How can you follow such an evil man. Wake up America, look at how this man lie. \ud83c\udd98\ud83c\udd98\n\u56de\u590d @Franklin_Graham @realDonaldTrump It is the Republicans who cheat, Biden won the 2020 election, why can\u2019t you give Biden his due credit. It bothers me to see a minister to be so one sided when it comes to right and wrong.\ud83c\udd98\ud83c\udd98\n\u56de\u590d @EricTrump @JesseBWatters Trump is a Criminal, He only want to be President to turn this Country into his control. He wants to be like Putin. How was he able to manipulate the Republican Party. He could never have done that with the Dems. How can people be so dumb\ud83c\udd98\n\u56de\u590d @FoxNews Remember folks Fox News always report lies, you can\u2019t believe what they say or post. Who is the biggest liar when it comes to News.

Trump and his wife sleep in separate room. Just last week he was walking towards her car and she slam the door on him, he had to go to the next car. She is sticking around because he is paying her to. There is no marriage there just an arrangement\n\u56de\u590d @Mollyploofkins Yes someone does get hurt Trump when you do bad things. Why do you say it was ok. Why do you keep on doing bad things. You have no discipline about your self. You threaten people when they don\u2019t agree with your bad behavior. But if these fools want to set in jail while you walk,\n\u56de\u590d @FoxNews If anyone thinks Trump is a good Businessman, they are blind. The only thing Trump is good at is fooling people and getting them to do his dirty work. He go free they go to jail.\n\u56de\u590d @POTUS My heart hurt for the Palestinians, no one seems to care about the people of Palestine. It is a shame how Israel kills the Palestinians &amp; leaders all over the world says  nothing. People please pray for the Palestinians.

So does this mean that Trump is the king of the GOP party and what he says goes? What are the people on the right so afraid of Trump.\n\u56de\u590d @REVMAXXING I am a full blooded Dem, but I refuse to vote for Biden for letting Israel slaughter all those Palestinians. And I will never vote for Trump because he is a criminal himself.\n\u56de\u590d @MSNBC @CoriBush @JoyAnnReid @thereidout Love Cori Bush, she is a hard working woman. \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\n\u56de\u590d @RpsAgainstTrump Remember folk, Tim Scott tried to get a bill passed that would pay cops not to kill black folks. I will always remember Tim Scott for that bill. Do you remember that bill?\ud83c\udd98\ud83c\udd98\ud83c\udd98\n\u56de\u590d @RpsAgainstTrump Trump Campaign is full of Chaos and Biden Campaign is full of Discipline. What do you think about that. Trump has been nothing but Chaos for the past decade. How can you leave when your life is in Shambles.\ud83c\udd98\ud83c\udd98\ud83c\udd98\n\u56de\u590d @ACTBrigitte Why would anyone who care about justice &amp; the Law vote for Trump. He is Lawless, he can\u2019t control himself. He carry on like a child, look at what\u2019s going on in the courtrooms with Trump. Why would you put him in charge of a Country. How many women have he sexually abused them. \ud83c\udd98\n\u56de\u590d @Franklin_Graham When the Republicans get in office Franklin Graham, they don\u2019t do anything but investigate. The GOP lead house is in chaos, they want to shut down the government.  Lauren B smoking pot and fighting with her hubby. Majorie T should be locked up. Trump hope the economy fail.\ud83c\udd98\ud83c\udd98\n\u56de\u590d @MSNBC I want to know how I can donate to Cori Bush Campaign and the Representative from New York. \ud83c\udd98\n\u56de\u590d @laurieinri @ChuckCallesto Laurie you think like Trump , I am glade we have an awesome GOD, he tolerate no evil. You are evil suggesting that Waste Management do such an awful thing. Go ahead and follow Trump to hell.\n\u56de\u590d @FireyTopaz Everything that comes in contact with Trump rots away. \ud83c\udd98\n\u56de\u590d @angeloinchina You are so right, what is wrong with Israel, they want to wipe out the Palestinians, I had a revelation that if Trump wins, he and Netanyahu has a plan to wipe out the Palestinians. Folks wake up before it\u2019s too late. \ud83c\udd98\ud83c\udd98\ud83c\udd98\n\u56de\u590d @Franklin_Graham @LibertyU Why not call all wrong out Franklin Graham, then people would be able to look at you and say \u201che calls it like it is\u201d no you have this one sided justice. You never say anything good about any Democrat. You support rapists on the right, on the left, \u201clock them up\u201d hypocrite.\n\u56de\u590d @thereidout All people who are familiar with the Military know in order to get out of the Military at a certain time, you have to put your paper work in ahead of time. That is months before you get out. It is a long process. Vance is making a big deal about nothing. Did Vance go to war?\n\u56de\u590d @SebGorka How many people have gone to jail because of Trump, vs how many people have gone to jail because of Biden? That tells you there who is corrupt. Hate crimes against Black have risen since Trump has being campaigning for President. Trump is unfit for the Whitehouse.\ud83c\udd98\ud83c\udd98\n\u56de\u590d @SUBRATA30016572 Trump and his wife don\u2019t sleep in the same room. They don\u2019t have a marriage, they have an arrangement. Trump wife hate him, don\u2019t try to pump their relationship up because there is none. She shut the door in his face a few weeks ago because she didn\u2019t want to ride with him.\ud83c\udd98\ud83c\udd98\n\u56de\u590d @Chicago1Ray Trump sues everyone, they don\u2019t make it to court because they get toss out.

The beauty of orthodoxy is the belief in a God who died for us, something that cannot be found and fathomed in other beliefs. https://t.co/bLTtf4YUE9\nJudas said the same thing.  Also, the Catholic Church is still the most charitable organization in the world. And it\u2019s miles away from the second, whatever it is.\nWhy continue to participate in religious charades by only going Mass on Sundays but continue to participate in sin?  Might as well leave the Church if all you do is live a life of degeneracy while continuing to receive communion on Sundays.\nI am literally and obviously being stopped by forces from deepening my prayer life.

Courage means heart and that's what it takes down to face down evil. Evil backwards is live, meaning evil actions destroy the possibility of others to live life. What was done to Hope was evil and we cant let it go on\n\u56de\u590d @aristrixar @nywolforg (1/3) Its seems counter intuitive, but killing a whole pack for a predation event is not good. 1 they kill wolves that are not guilty. 2 killing a pack means another pack will move in. 3 lethal measures being the first choice jeopardizes the wolf's long term survival.  -\n\u56de\u590d @_AnimalAdvocate @rickygervais @carolvorders @DeborahMeaden @PeterEgan6 @Protect_Wldlife @domdyer70 @Veganella_ @NickTaylorLLB @ARCrusade @moulouanne @veganfuture @peteswildlife @mrjamesob @hilltopgina @HuntSabs @XposeTrophyHunt @BanbloodsportNI The person who saved that fox is a straight up fucking hero. Bucking the barbaric and absolutely evil norms of this sick society to save someone who has gets no moral consideration is pure courage. Let alone the potential to be punished for doing the right thing. Hero, total Hero\n\u56de\u590d @NHCART @GovKristiNoem People who do this love death. Its a death fetish. They are necromancers. I cannot fathom why doing this is acceptable and how someone can be so heinous, evil and cruel.\n\u56de\u590d @AmUmbria It would be great if Americans brought Wyoming to its knees economically. Harsh? Well they aid, abed, support, and protect psychopaths who torture wolves and their children. Wolf hatred should never be tolerated and seen as unacceptable as racism.\n\u56de\u590d @endangered Wolf moms always make me happy.\n\u56de\u590d @AnimalsRSomeone @ryandbusse @AltYelloNatPark Precisely. I saw nothing in their eyes but a black pit. There's nothing there and maybe that's why they are so cruel to wolves.\n\u56de\u590d @OWStarr @Aqutaq Princess spicypants. Love her &lt;3\n\u56de\u590d @AmUmbria I love Iqniq. Gentle giant and best dad.\n\u56de\u590d @OWStarr The unconscious quest for a perpetual motion machine is going to make humans extinct. Sorry humans, immortality is not in the cards. Accept you're gonna die and just live and get over yourselves.\n1/20 people in society are psychopaths. There is only one cure. https://t.co/N3Y7mbHvnN\n\u56de\u590d @aristrixar @nywolforg and in Minnesota they actually documented increase livestock predation after wolf hunting seasons, as well as additive mortality in wolf packs. Basically it encourages killing wolves, and as many as possible, and that's not good, nor is it effective.\n\u56de\u590d @NHCART This is the face the dominant culture makes as it marches the entire planet towards annihilation.\n\u56de\u590d @Son_of_Space I want to suggest a reclassification of the human species. More accurately, they are homo-mercator (merchant man) because commerce and greed are the sole defining quality of the human species. There absence of wisdom and prevalence of greed and sadism is on full display.\nMajestic photo of Tikani I took last year. I was out cleaning and filling everyone's water and was just awestruck when I looked up the hill and saw him sunbathing. https://t.co/lvNRsg2mGC\n\u56de\u590d @AmUmbria The whole world witness the psychopathy inflicted upon wolves in the Wildlife Slaughter States of America. And it should be known that this is the NORM with the sadists that hate wolves. 'Predator control' is a hate group/death cult.\n\u56de\u590d @NHCART I wonder if there is a way we can form organizations to sabotage hunting and trapping. That would be great. I hate to be sarcastic, but holding our breathes for  bureaucretins to spawn on a soul is getting wolves, coyotes, ect killed while the liars and murderers pocket money.\nhttps://t.co/ZxrleMJ4ZA\u2026 #Cdnpoli #wolves #Wyomingwolftorture \"Wildlife Services\" is an Orwellian term for an agency that effectively functions as Nazi Gestapo, but for ranchers and against wild animals. They kill with impunity and few have the courage to speak out against it.\nhttps://t.co/cJd21YMsts U.S. Treatment of wolves is brutal, illegal, and partisan. Wolf hating sadists shouldn't be anywhere near wolf conservation or wildlife management. #relistwolves #banwolfhunting #stoprecreationalwolfslaughter #bantrophyhunting\n\u56de\u590d @tommy_mcspadden @WolfWarriorLoki @Change Before you preach the propaganda to sell the hunter consumer identity, look at this https://t.co/rA93Nf8nWv. Biodiversity has increased and is thriving without humans encroaching. The idea that human hunters are necessary is absurd. Its pure hubris and totally unfounded.\n\u56de\u590d @AltYelloNatPark @AnimalsRSomeone @ryandbusse Exactly. It's not about what's true. All the wolf haters and their groups are is a nexus of rationalizations to justify hatred. They're not better than a black lynch mob or a Nazi Gestapo. The nexus of 'predator control' is a hate group. Wolves are hunters. Humans are predators.\n\u56de\u590d @Howling4Wolves All wolf killing does is break hearts and ruin families. Whenever someone asks me 'why are you against wolf hunting?\" I say 'how would you feel if a lunatic broke into your house and shot your wife, kids, you, or gunned you all down because the laws had no restraint?\nhttps://t.co/zmXyURkXKd The real beast of waste and desolation exposed; humans who are greedy, selfish, psychopathic, sadistic, and narcissistic. They slaughter the animals and poison the earth and must be stopped.\n\u56de\u590d @aristrixar @nywolforg (2/3)We want to employ non-lethal methods as the standard issue because resident wolf packs can be conditioned to avoid livestock operations. Livestock Guardian dogs, fladry, dig proof fencing, flashing lights, alarm systems that scare wolves are just examples.
