Us passing safe haven laws under Roe DOES NOT prove that.  So, sit down and prove it or shut up\n\"And obviously if you are advocating for children to be able to receive abortions, that alone wouldn't be indicia of abuse.\"  Anti-choicers, everyone. They think the rape of a child, and subsequent medical care, isn't indicative of abuse because we ALLOW the medical care.\n\u56de\u590d @Reinedem @cc_jovita @Gidi_Traffic How well can you cook?\n\u56de\u590d @AENMAD @theevilwriter @thesadgirl911 I know plenty more than you.

Forced pregnancy is slavery\n\u56de\u590d @AuntieTelly02 @sliderulesyou @ask_aubry Hell, my favorite wine is boxed and it's shocked everyone that's ever tasted it after talking shit. So she can buy a great box and an overpriced bottle in one night\n\u56de\u590d @Jonatha70760412 @ulxma More like it's men that don't love their babies and therefore don't file for custody. It takes money to support your children. You are literally admitting that you want them to go without. Yes, I would cheer for you to go to jail, too.\n\u56de\u590d @JVODre @jiggyjayy2 \"Girls in hs\" so not women. Exactly.  Understanding that someone is older than you and therefore more mature is VERY Different to understanding that it's not a good thing\n\u56de\u590d @El_guayase @Journey3519 @redusa21 Most people are smarter than you and recognize that rape, abuse, severe poverty, etc are hell. No, someone that'll never have a chance to be ANYTHING because they're going to die, be deprived of opportunities, or be too fucked up to function doesn't have a good life.\n\u56de\u590d @BlurryCat9000 @sliderulesyou @ask_aubry Bahaha sure, man. That's why divorce wasn't really a thing until women having jobs and the right to own things became a thing.\n\u56de\u590d @Craig97422990 @bluntedbadd_ @status_culture @NezaFoju @jiggyjayy2 \"That's a lie\" no tf it isn't. A grown man acting 18 is embarrassing.  Learn to spell.  A young person liking an older person isn't them being a predator. That same older adult liking that young person IS a predator, creep.

However, it certainly doesn't negate abortion rights. I don't get the other guy's point\nIt's now gross to tell minors men shouldn't be masturbating to them.  Hear that, everyone? Sounds a lot like wanting men to jack it to you\n\u56de\u590d @shesayme @notsinkingbones Did you not see the photo? What part of that says \"planned pregnancy,\" and why lecture her if you thought that  Also, yes there is a tone there. The deadpan of it is so commonly used to be negative that even I, an autistic woman understand it.  What point was it, exactly?\n\u56de\u590d @adamfare1996 Iirc, certain countries don't even allow autistic immigrants.  Why the hell would someone limit where they can go to be refused resources anyway\n\u56de\u590d @Sadface4566 No, bc you are wrong. Binges have bad consequences, but that doesn't at ALL relate to their cause or the goal of them.  You really don't get the point\n\u56de\u590d @graceg1413 @Besser100 @Badgrlstrange Yep. And in those cases it's not even just the pregnant person in danger- three fetuses can rarely share a womb without one or more being essentially starved/not having enough room to grow.
