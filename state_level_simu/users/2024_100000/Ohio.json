What fresh hell is this \ud83d\ude33?\n\u56de\u590d @physicianassoci @MHG1910 @PatrickMackle4 Definitely not the fault of PAs, this has been pushed from high up to the detriment of Drs who get paid less than assistants yet responsible for their errors. Can understand their frustration 100%. Also PAs now work ~ neonates,  neurosurgery, paeds, after 2yr training. Drs can't\n\u56de\u590d @Monopotandpan @WindrushLives Me too at the time.

I'm rather confused about this. Many things trouble me about the PA role, most of which relate to pt safety and blurring their role with Drs. Eg seeing undifferentiated pts, assessing, diagnosing etc.\n\u56de\u590d @HealthFirstAK @mouseter_chef @dasairway And downright dangerous at worst. There are no quick/easy fixes to replace our doctors. The 5-6yrs in medschool provide the *fundamental* knowledge, skills and competences reqd to practice  safely. Imagine the myriad of unfilled gaps in the *2yr* PA training \ud83d\ude28\ud83d\ude31 #ValueOurDrs\n\u56de\u590d @physicianassoci @MHG1910 @PatrickMackle4 Also want to thank you for engaging. When sick I put my trust in the rigorous training, knowledge &amp; expertise of *Drs* acqd over many yrs. After 2yrs training I believe PAs have too many gaps in their knowledge base &amp; don't know what they don't know. As a pt this is a huge worry.\n\u56de\u590d @jkcyriac23 @Xeon4f145d96s1 @DrNeenaJha @gmcuk Please can you define \"profession\" and explain what it is that PAs do that doctors can't do? We patients feel our healthcare *is* being watered down because PAs have only a *fraction* of the training &amp; expertise of Drs. This genuinely concerns me. We pts don't feel safe.\n\u56de\u590d @Vedzy @Dr__Sarmy There's a reason why drs-to-be need excellent grades to get into medschool: medicine is very complex, requiring an extraordinary amount of knowledge to be learnt over 5-6 yrs along with hands-on clinical competence. Life/death decisions  often have to be made under time pressure\n\u56de\u590d @DrNeenaJha These are such troubling times. This constant attack on doctors, diminishing their role &amp; value in healthcare simultaneously means that patient safety is being destroyed.

Good riddence!!\n\u56de\u590d @carolvorders For anyone who doesn't yet know about this huge scandal, they're called Physicians Associates (PAs) &amp; have completed a mere *2yr course* before being let loose on the public, whilst GPs train for a min of 10yrs!! They're unregulated  &amp; unskilled, putting patients at risk. Beware\nDear public, we need to STOP the roll out of PAs&amp;AAs \u26d4 Did you know that Anaesthesia Associates are being used instead of *specialist Drs* to intubate pts undergoing surgery? Often with no direct supervision? Do patients know &amp; consent for this? What if something goes wrong? \ud83d\ude31\n\u56de\u590d @Alison6123 @drmattuk @medicalmodelbri @FPARCP @RBNHSFT @NHSE_WTE \ud83d\udcaf. From day 1 post qualification F1 Drs work *autonomously*, many have little recourse to ongoing supervision from a consultant. Most learn that you contact the consultant only when absolutely needed &amp; make independent clinical judgements based on this. Quite different to PAs!\n\u56de\u590d @gmcuk urgent action is needed  to protect pts from too many PAs working out of their depth. So many cases are being flagged up and more patients will die. You have a duty to protect us from harm caused by non-doctors. The NHS is not a laboratory for this failed PA experiment.\n\u56de\u590d @NJL_Blancq @aboabisabit @OcoRory @Dr_Done_ @NHSEngland I believe it should be a level playing field. It isn't. End of.\n\u56de\u590d @GMCharlatan But PA is not a \"profession\" is it? They have no autonomy or unique body of knowledge. This basic but very important concept needs to be thrashed out ASAP. Too many assumptions have already been made and, with respect, I can't see how PA meet the criteria.\n\u56de\u590d @AlisonGeorge10 @NHSEngland @DHSCgovuk @rcgp @KamilaRCGP @NHSEmployers @NHSE_WTE @NavinaEvans The more I see of these these cuckoo land job descriptions for PAs, the clearer it becomes that this whole situation is OUT OF CONTROL. Who writes these?  Do they engage brain cells, giving people with 2yr training and no experience  responsibility for pt health in primary care?\nEveryone should watch this video. Literally everyone, in every country across the entire world. And not look away from start to end. Please share widely, whatever your take or beliefs, for the sake of humanity.\n\u56de\u590d @medicalmodelbri You go Brioche, call them out. We patients are NOT to be used as PA 'trophies' ffs. It's bad enough feeling we're guinea pigs for them to practice on without any kind of consultation \ud83d\ude10 #EndthePAAAExperiment\n\u56de\u590d @BMA_James_Steen What action will @TheBMA @gmcuk take in relation to this scandalous use of PAs to replace Drs rotas? It's outrageous and presumably unlawful on many levels? The PAs aren't even registered! Were they ALL supervised ? Did pts know they were PAs and gave consent?

It also helped in achieving a calm and serious focus on the problems to overcome.\n\u56de\u590d @greta While I like Rubio, I don't think being VP would work out well for him. It could be a career ending move. I like Dr. Carson or Vivek. It would help Trump as they are both well spoken.\n\u56de\u590d @BrendaC32776704 @Cadvleague This is true, but if we can also affect policy decisions, that would be great.

I said that's not a problem. You did not address any other avenue of collecting and disseminating information outside of official court records. I am not disputing anything you said. Saying no cameras is Constitutional.\n\u56de\u590d @jihadwatchRS It looks like they are not interested in occupying the land, but in making it impossible to occupy.\n\u56de\u590d @HumblyB Were I lived, the VW bug was so common slugging, if done at all, was reserved for padiddles. But for my family this was only a race to see who would say it first.\nConsider it pure joy, my brothers, when you encounter trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith develops perseverance. James 1:2-3 BSB\n\u56de\u590d @ToddTrotter3 @anna_murphhh It is easy to become double-minded. Ananias and Sapphira were, Simon who had been a wonder worker was as well. To be one off from holiness is a compromise that is dangerous. Diligence is necessary and difficult.\n\u56de\u590d @DMozer5 @Alicesverige @CherylWroteIt @JoeBiden @POTUS I understand this. My grandma, along with her parents, was from Armenia but lived in Shanghai. The rest is a long story, as is yours.\n\u56de\u590d @Magister_Mondo Geography \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\nBe sober-minded and alert. Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour. Resist him, standing firm in your faith and in the knowledge that your brothers throughout the world are undergoing the same kinds of suffering. 1 Peter 5:8-9 BSB\n\u56de\u590d @greta No matter which way it goes it will be divisive for the public. The parties' conventions are not likely to be surrounded with peace. The year 1968 comes to mind. I would like it to be otherwise.\n\u56de\u590d @mikesra1 @RealJamesWoods Biden was the main thing that kept many of us from thinking about an Obama impeachment. It simply seemed insane to put him in the Oval Office.\n\u56de\u590d @DMozer5 @Alicesverige @CherylWroteIt @JoeBiden @POTUS I would like to see where my great grandparents and my grandma lived. It is also where my grandparents met. There are pictures of my dad as a toddler sitting with his grandparents on a bench in Shanghai. They were visiting. My dad never lived in Shanghai.\n\u56de\u590d @backpewguy I'm applying for jobs in my new profession and I'm in my early 60s. I'm looking for elementary teaching positions in a Christian environment.

Declare His glory among the nations, His wonderful deeds among all peoples.

Jeremiah 31:25 ESV\n\u56de\u590d @RobSchneider Apparently Seattle is closing many of its schools, so the external pressure to change is there, but can they? This curriculum was approved by the voters and mandated for all public schools.\n\u56de\u590d @Donwisizu @callyourdad911 @Sachinettiyil No, I'm not confused. Many who are Roman Catholic see themselves as being the totality of Christianity, which would mean they are a religion. Some believe it includes Orthodox and others whose Christianity was delivered personally by one or more of the twelve apostles.\n\u56de\u590d @nathanafinn @deaninserra Of course it's all fiction, but Kit was so focused on winning that she used everything she had, and Dottie thoroughly enjoyed the game, but would not win at any cost. So I agree with you. Still, it's only movie.\nBut in fact Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. 1 Corinthians 15:20 ESV  He showed us sin earns death when He took our sin upon Himself and died brutal death to save us from what we deserve. He rose showing His power over death.\n\u56de\u590d @usnavyband Day is done, gone the sun From the lakes, from the hills, from the ski All is well, safely rest God is nigh  This is the first verse to Taps which I was taught as part of the closing ceremony of every Girl Scout meeting for our troop.\n\u56de\u590d @rayskidude @dilipkjena I think deferring to others is essential, especially if we see that person has the big picture and we don't. Some issues are organizational, some are preference, and some are essential spiritual truths. The first two can be compromised, but the last must be kept #HealthyFaithChat\n\u56de\u590d @rfgeier @Wisdom_is_Truth @wideawake_media I have not seen this quote before, but Theodore Roosevelt is quite accurately describing himself.

Like broken records. And David, by his own admission, props them up. They\u2019re good men, he says \u2014 it\u2019s just that his definition of good is not good for women (and frequently their children).\n\u56de\u590d @SwearingsCaring Even in churches that don\u2019t break out Gothard\u2019s umbrella diagram, there\u2019s still a correlation between \u201cyou need a savior\u201d and \u201cyou need a husband.\u201d That need to be needed is strong.   When there\u2019s no woman to rescue, no maiden to save, a lot of these guys don\u2019t know what to do.\n\u56de\u590d @DavidDark @JesterWootton @adamrshields @adamjoycechi @greg_thornbury @vhobbs5 It helps me understand how the PCA wound up here. Through her own story, Dr. Hobbs traces the fault lines of a neo-confederate, patriarchal theology that\u2014from where I\u2019m sitting\u2014only survives by feeding on the most vulnerable among them. It\u2019s Midnight Mass with a trinity hymnal.\n\u56de\u590d @MgivenUp You\u2019re not alone.
