I think for Boston, you can bring Niang in for non-Tatum minutes, but that\u2019s it. Matchups are too important in the playoffs to be exposed on D. It\u2019s why JB has reticent to play Sam Merrill more than 5-8 min a game\n\u56de\u590d @Tony_Pesta Yup, representation matters.  It\u2019s hard for some folks who have always seen others who look like them in American popular culture to fathom how much it means to those who didn\u2019t have that representation in the past to finally experience it.\n\u56de\u590d @ChrisFedor Niang\u2019s 11 minutes. Inexcusable when Game 5 is on tape. The offense at the end of the game was high pnr or Spain action &amp; there was no 2nd action, just Mitchell iso. Simple to defend. Not starting Mobley &amp; Morris in the 4th for Niang &amp; Thompson &amp; not subbing until 9:52 left 1/2\n\u56de\u590d @ericrennerbrown All these numbers are within the margin of error my guy (not exactly \u201cgetting washed\u201d), so that\u2019s not spin / I\u2019m not in PR.

Niang just got beaten on the boards by Pritchard for that last putback. You know, the same Pritchard that he couldn\u2019t finish over when he\u2019s 7 inches taller. He has to stop playing him seriously wtf\n\u56de\u590d @ericrennerbrown A lot bigger, probably. I think it\u2019s because he doesn\u2019t have much of a \u201cpersona\u201d other than \u201cnice, self-deprecating guy with acoustic guitar who writes some decent, poppy tunes\u201d  \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\u56de\u590d @Tony_Pesta In all honesty though - and JB has been great this season - but why is Donovan still on the floor? Or any of the starters? Nothing good can come from it at this point; the game has already been decided.\n\u56de\u590d @AmNotEvan Good idea, but why not bring Evan off the bench to help stagger minutes between him and Allen\u2026especially with Mobley on a minutes restriction?\n\u56de\u590d @armchairvp @RickMas27448357 @PeteButtigieg Wow, a publicly funded project is slow to implement, shocker! \ud83d\ude44  Anyone w/ experience working in a bureaucracy knows about lags between laws passed &amp; enacted, especially when DOT has never worked w/ electric vehicles.

Why is Maria Manaura, one of the migrant criminals staying at the Row Hotel for 6 months?  Who's watching her kids while she's out committing crimes?\nIs Eric Adams going to be the least rotten apple as a choice for mayor?    NY is doomed with Brad Lander.  If Eric Adams gets in again NY will have another 4 years in a downhill spiral with out-of-control migrants committing crimes.  Hopefully a strong republican tries to run.\n\u56de\u590d @NYCMayor @GovKathyHochul @NYCCouncil @SenSchumer @AOC @ManhattanDA  Dems in control destroyed NY.  They don't care what crimes migrants commit.  They won't deport the migrants.  Maybe they will regret it when NY doesn't have any taxpayers left, only migrants sending money home.\n\u56de\u590d @ViralNewsNYC The Post should hire you.  I hope they paid you &amp; acknowledged you in their article.  I'm surprised Adams doesn't try to stop you from reporting on migrant crime. Adams says that the media is fear mongering.  Saying crime is up is in the minds of NYers. Adams claims NY is safe.\n\u56de\u590d @NYCMayor Eric Adam's claims 1200 migrants left the shelter system.  Where, oh where did they go?  Are they sleeping in the subway, under a bridge or in a park?  They definitely didn't find a job where they can afford NY's rent. https://t.co/SZbzabjF9T\n\u56de\u590d @NYCMayor @nytimes @ABC @PIX11News @NBCNews @FoxNews Where is the major news media when these crimes by migrants (stabbings) occur?  Are they taking a cue from Eric Adams and not covering it so Adams can continue with his lie that crime is down?   https://t.co/QGBwstVWcx\n\u56de\u590d @NYCMayor When is Eric Adam's going to install metal detectors in all shelters?  This might prevent migrants from walking NY with knives or guns.  Cops looking for migrant accused of stabbing asylum-seeker outside converted NYC hotel https://t.co/BVyoajCYgB via @nypmetro\n\u56de\u590d @VickieforNYC These illegals are here for nothing but a free ride.  If they were really seeking asylum, fleeing violence they would be doing everything possible to learn English, file for asylum &amp; working papers, spend time looking for a job.  They spend their time committing crimes.\n\u56de\u590d @NYCMayor  Get ready Eric Adams because  New York needs new jails. Venezuela won't take back it's criminals that are deported so you will need a place to house them.  It's not just Venezuelan's.  NYC has a lot of migrant criminals that don't deserve to live in NY.\n\u56de\u590d @NYCMayor @GovKathyHochul  Why haven't the mayor or governor said anything about the gang members in Queens selling fake social security cards, NY identification cards, etc to migrants?  They are ignoring it as long as migrants can start working.\n\u56de\u590d @NYCMayor Eric Adams continues to lie that crime is down.  It's great that murders are down, but assaults and robberies are way up.

Security or staff at the shelters probably look the other way when migrants go through the metal detectors, if the shelters actually have metal detectors.  I don't think they do.  Too many migrants have weapons.\n\u56de\u590d @NYCMayor To become a lifeguard in NYC you must complete the Municipal Lifeguard Training Program, which is probably taught in English. Is the mayor going to offer the training in all languages spoken by migrants? What makes a migrant an excellent swimmer?\n\u56de\u590d @NYCMayor  Why should migrants in NYC get more money on a food debit card than low income families on SNAP?  A family of 4 in NY on SNAP gets $973 a month (max amount) meanwhile a migrant family of 4 gets $1400 a month and they get to buy baby supplies.\nMigrants enter the U.S. illegally and make there way to NY expecting a hotel room and get it.  Homeless veterans and homeless New Yorkers get to sleep in a train station with rats.  They might get a homeless shelter set up years ago but not a hotel room. @NYCMayor\nThe future of NY doesn't look to good if it remains a sanctuary city &amp; the NY Council won't deport. There are too many migrant criminals running rampant throughout NY.  We have some migrants using mopeds delivering food, but there are more migrants using mopeds to commit crimes.\n\u56de\u590d @JoeBiden @VP The US is doomed if Harris becomes president.  She will let a million more in.  Her donors want cheap labor.  That is all they care about.  Biden didn't secure the border. Biden just sneaks them in at night.  Harris will to.  https://t.co/PxibDfmChu\nAdams claims he met Wole Coaxum, during his campaign. Guess that\u2019s enough to skip making deals that are in the best interest of the taxpayer. The debit cards are to be handed off to a population with no real legal identity, no ID restrictions and no meaningful fraud-control.\nThe NYPD is saying that some are migrants.

Migrants are stealing the illegal stolen scooters that migrants are using for food deliveries.\n\u56de\u590d @ViralNewsNYC Eric Adams has more control over major media than he does the migrants.

Why is it fair for the women duties to come to a \"hard stop\" or significantly drop after the kids are gone but yet the man will have to work until he is physically disabled, dies, or fortunate enough to retire with his unappreciative whining wife? https://t.co/yKWH3JPWDl\n\u56de\u590d @Lingzi_W Does she submit to her husband?

Self preservation.\n\u56de\u590d @BelfastBeatnik @inmyownfashion2 We protected women at one time but where labeled as controlling.

The other is feminine, appreciative, respectful, and grateful. You know, everything a man would want in a wife.\n\u56de\u590d @nicholasig13 Why is your fiancee telling you what you can and can't do? Your child will need a father and your wife needs a husband. This is a shit test from her.

She would expect her husband to pick up more hours/find another job to accommodate her.\n\u56de\u590d @JVLSRQ @XRPLion1 The hardware wallet is like adding another lock on the blockchain contract that shows your ownership of the token amount stored in the wallet.
