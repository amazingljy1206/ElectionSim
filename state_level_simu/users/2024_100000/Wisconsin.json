Ok, maybe I'm dreaming \ud83d\ude02\n\u56de\u590d @islandlife71 @Miralumira @airdronians It is not medical information. It is just me passing along some common sense. Feel free to decline it if you would like! Not trying to force it on you.\n\u56de\u590d @GeorgeTapanes I really, really hope so! It's the best chance we have right now, and it's dire. Trump has screwed Bobby over in the past, but that was before he grew a massive grassroots movement. I think Trump respects that and will be more likely to want to take his advice going forward.\n\u56de\u590d @kitty_funk @Roblawz @islandlife71 @Miralumira The BB episode makes clear that in the 60's, people weren't afraid of measles because it was a benign childhood illness for *most* people. There were 3 to 4 million cases, with around 400-500 deaths (mostly sick ppl) before the vaccine came out. That means *most* ppl had no issue https://t.co/Q6wGy8ZTGe\n\u56de\u590d @islandlife71 @kitty_funk @Roblawz @Miralumira Do you think a sitcom today would show the kids with measles laughing and playing board games? We've changed our attitude toward the disease. That's my only point.\n\u56de\u590d @islandlife71 @MattDodson12 Because there was definitely a time when there was unvaccinated people getting the measles. It was unhealthy terminally ill kids who are the ones dying from it. Maybe a healthy person here and there but that was extremely rare.\n\u56de\u590d @ComicDaveSmith @Cancelcloco He obviously doesn't *want* to have to team up with Trump, as I suspect he might, he likely just realizes the DNC is the biggest problem we currently face right now. He might have underestimated how corrupt the DNC actually was.\n\u56de\u590d @airdronians @islandlife71 @Miralumira It was the most popular show on TV at the time and clearly show the public perception of the disease is that it was not dangerous. The flu can be dangerous for some people. It doesn't mean it's something we all need to worry about.\n\u56de\u590d @markwellsrector @NickKoutrakos @libsoftiktok I've seen this before, it's a common tactic by leftist. If something is happening that's horrific, rather than actually say it's horrific they just pretend it's not happening.\nI never in my life thought I'd say this about a politician, but @RobertKennedyJr is a true American hero. He's one of the good guys, hands down. And let's be honest-it's in his blood, but Bobby is not a typical \"politician.\" I hope he makes it to DC this Nov one way or another!\nScrew the DNC \ud83e\udd2c\n\u56de\u590d @AlexBerenson @realDonaldTrump LMFAO. What a joke you are, Alex \ud83e\udd23\n\u56de\u590d @EndTribalism .@KerryKennedyRFK, you are obviously the betrayal. You are a disgusting human who puts political power over family.

Mine is saving the Republic.\n\u56de\u590d @neelanism @RobertKennedyJr I'll be voting for him in CO but hoping others in swing states do as he asks so we can get him in the WH ASAP. He's got shit to do!! \ud83e\udd29\ud83d\ude09 Mad love to my fellow #RFKJr supporters. LFG!!!!!\n\u56de\u590d @bmahonthatsit @RobertKennedyJr He recently kinda took back the full term sentiment after the commentary and reactions from the Sage Steel interview. He seems to like the idea of making it illegal after the baby is viable and can live outside the womb. I definitely appreciate his ability to keep an open mind.\n\u56de\u590d @Miralumira @islandlife71 Most people clearly did not die from the measles. I never said they are the same as the chickenpox. But they are both a benign childhood disease.\n\u56de\u590d @ComicDaveSmith @Cancelcloco Bobby Kennedy has principles. He is an extremely intelligent guy with a ton of integrity. He does what is right in the moment. He's not the kind of guy who would try to be strategic about something when leaving the Democratic party is the message he wants to send.\n\u56de\u590d @Sean05Evans @Miralumira @islandlife71 Why do you bring up chicken pox? This post was about measles. Chicken pox is not the same thing. I had chicken pox (someone asked), but not measles. What is confusing?\n\u56de\u590d @cmacturn @AntonioSabatoJr No, he did not. Obviously.\n\u56de\u590d @BryceMLipscomb @RobertKennedyJr @NicoleShanahan It's going to be ok, Bryce! I may be wrong, but I have a really good feeling about this. There is no way Bobby is done, he might just be changing strategies \ud83d\ude03 I trust he knows exactly what we should do. Either way, you and I are not done fighting together to save the Republic!\nThis was an incredible interview!\n\u56de\u590d @Zed0074 @RobertKennedyJr He recently said he likes the idea of putting a limit on how long women can have an abortion. He is open to changing his mind &amp; is quite a thoughtful person.

A great option to read this summer: \"If You Take Me to Kentucky\" by Sylvia Holden. It highlights all the things that make our commonwealth so special.  Visit https://t.co/PMr2wBtBpm for the full read. https://t.co/FhocExEEVj\nOne of my favorite parts about being First Lady is geting to meet remarkable young women from across the commonwealth who are leaders in their communities.

Today, some of these talented students visited the Capitol, and we got to celebrate them. https://t.co/5rascdURVG\nOur next KY woman to highlight: Julia Britton Hooks.  At 17, she attended Berea College. She became a music teacher there, and was the first African American on the faculty. She shared the joy of music with countless people and was a trailblazer in education. #WomensHistoryMonth https://t.co/V3zPrzrBPk\nThank you to the students and staff at Arlington Elementary for inviting me to be your guest reader this week as part of the Scholastic REAL Read Program. It truly never gets old to see Kentucky kids' faces light up with joy during a good book! https://t.co/8riPg2VCrP\nStop by the Capitol to see this year's Derby Exhibit! It features artists from around the commonwealth depicting Kentucky's natural beauty and landscapes.

It was a great day visiting Thorn Hill Education Center to read books and promote family literacy in the commonwealth. https://t.co/DwvWY4Lf4o\nI'm so proud to partner again with @Kroger, @FoodCity and @ZeroVKentucky for the annual Shop &amp; Share.

And let's continue to work together to expand access to quality and compassionate care across the commonwealth. https://t.co/fqBwakohOE\nKentucky has so much natural beauty in our historic caves, rivers and forests. On #EarthDay let's show our commonwealth a little love. You can pick up trash, shop at a local farmer's market or visit one of our state parks! Let's make sure KY is beautiful for generations to come. https://t.co/GOqKVte9nk\nWe're establishing wrap-around services to address all of our kids' needs.  \u2705New program to provide children with nutritious food over summer break. \u2705New federal grant to establish mental and physical health care in schools.

Ellie saved her dad's life by recognizing the signs of a stroke and making sure he received proper care. Ellie \u2013 you are a true hero and an inspiration to all of us. https://t.co/b06DHMPTEi\nAs a mom, and as First Lady, there's nothing more precious to me than protecting Kentucky's kids.
