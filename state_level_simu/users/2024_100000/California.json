If he wins the nomination, I will likely push MT to leans Republican.\n\u56de\u590d @PosterTubs It's mostly noise, the types of voters polled who happened to be from NW may not reflect the actual demographics there, but still contribute to a fairly accurate composite of the state overall.

I would certainly assume this hurts Trump but be wary of hypothetical polls. \"A serious crime\" can be easily misinterpreted or assumed to be worse by a poll respondent\nI think this is probably the most likely way for Trump to win, but it seems more likely to me that higher turnout voters, like the Indies who broke dem in 2022, will represent a larger portion of the electorate than in 2020, giving Biden a turnout advantage. We'll see.\nThere is no objective \"retirement age\", but SS was not created to fully fund a comfortable retirement for the final third/fourth of your life, it was designed so that elderly and disabled people aren't dying in the street. It's current implementation is broken, and needs changes.\n\u56de\u590d @ReaganCoolidge Biden probably won't get a trifecta (let alone one as far left as him), but things really won't change much even if Trump wins. He is nowhere near competent enough to enact such change, look at the 1st term. It would be different if DeSantis won, he would fix some stuff\nIt would be nice if GOP had serious opposition to Biden. I'm very open-minded about some restrictions on legal immigration, and most people want the border secured. But you know what I'm not open minded about? 4 more years of trump running his mouth to feed his ego at our expense\n\u56de\u590d I refuse to be unhappy about this in any way. There's enough shitty stuff going on in the political world, it's nice to get a win!\nIn the long term, this is not a good thing for the GOP. they are losing high propensity, affluent (donation $$$) voters that are giving dems an advantage in midterms, state legislatures, and special elections. The new coalition is quite a bit weaker overall\n\u56de\u590d @clayforamerica Well Walz isn't really a centrist, he doesn't really hurt her but nothing to be gained. Shapiro is a real asset\nTook a nice day off from the bird app yesterday. More should consider doing the same once in a while. Anyway, the AZ poll is pretty damning for Lake as expected. Likely D once she is officially nominated, Lean D for now.\n\u56de\u590d @AndrewJ132 Pensions are a scam, just like social security. You get pennies on the dollar of your own money and reckless spending because of govt mismanagement.

A few years ago, he was on Eliquis. Everything was going great. Then insurance dropped that coverage. Cost was going to be $600/month. He was switched... 1\n\u56de\u590d @MelodyOw0 @TheAntifaTurtle Because teenagers? I was pretty on top of my boys' locations at all times but I had a pretty traumatic childhood with my less-paranoid parents.  Most parents who haven't experienced serious trauma are much more casual about their teens' activities.\n\u56de\u590d @Davelikesdisc @Blether87122608 @steveolivas Without delving into the details of a complex convo in such a limited medium... What is the benefit of having a job associated with your healthcare, so that when you get sick and lose said job you no longer have coverage?? There's no such thing as free, but change is reasonable.\n\u56de\u590d @docm77 @xBCrafted Oh man... I remember when he brought him home and I'm at best a casual viewer.  XB, So, so sorry.

Wasn't until I was raising my own kids that I realized how not-normal my own childhood was. I was lucky in not being abused, but was certainly neglected.\n\u56de\u590d @CaraTesoraMia @jack_turban I am also a huge fan of my air fryer! The versatility alone!

I attend online services now. I miss the companionship but access is limited by geography and disability.   Look for hope. That's my best advice. Campbell writes about world mythology and how human stories all tie together.\n\u56de\u590d @thatokmomx2 As a mom of now-adults who went through a VERY rough stage around that age, you are absolutely doing the right thing.  Include a talk with her about the purpose of the discipline and try to help her understand what made her rage so hard. Something triggered that emotion. 1\n\u56de\u590d @AuthorKaraJ You remember that all the good things in the world are equally interconnected, and are far bigger and stronger than the horrors. Light always drives darkness back.\n\u56de\u590d @rebeccacherman I wasn't able to find (at the time, ~25 years ago, and prior to being internet savvy) to find the equivilant book for boys, but Yep. I got this one for my kids (My own mother would've been horrified) and we talked about everything.\n\u56de\u590d @TracyWelborn6 @DelaKram75 Had Brian been my pastor, instead of a highly-learned theologian who implemented a program in our church of trained lay counselors who were not afraid to refer me to a professional psychiatrist, I would not be alive today.  These kinds of attitudes kill and are deeply heretical.\nGee, it'd be a REAL SHAME if this one went viral... Some petty narcissistic man-child might even get upset and try to suspend the accounts of those sharing it. Idgaf. lol Find me on BlueSky.  #FreeSpeech https://t.co/DXoEVvT3ih\n\u56de\u590d @Billieiswriting I heard an ad on my local Christian station- scenario was two friends, one kept \"witnessing\" to the other, but with no success, and they drifted apart... The take away was \"don't be like him, keep trying!\"   My dudes. The drifting apart was likely due to the MLM sceme pressure.\n\u56de\u590d @MrsPA_C And don't throw out that bread bag!

Learn what the hell you are looking at before hopping on a thread sounding dumb.\n\u56de\u590d @DrTJC @RenyTure You have to disaggregate the outgroup male category because Black Americans in general have a distinct relationship to Western civilization, and the idea of \"Race\" was initially conceived as a tool of oppression toward us after Bacon's Rebellion.\n\u56de\u590d @smithmatthew81 @dereckapurnell It's a cancer!\n\u56de\u590d @JayKazaam @saiyanbythesea We are not brothers and sisters.

Yet I\u2019ll hear about this all day like a tape recorder.\n\u56de\u590d @Naran_Rid @crypto_is_good @TheLizVariant @WallStreetSilv @EdKrassen I started using the term Hispanic because it became the new norm. Especially on applications. I did not see the term Mexican being used anywhere.\n\u56de\u590d @krassenstein @Travisradford10 Why do people have to check rates and wage growth? Why can\u2019t we just go by what we have in our pockets at the end of the month?

He is a world renowned pediatric brain surgeon. He was the first doctor to separate conjoined twins, that were connected by the head. He was also the head neurosurgeon at John Hopkins hospital.  He should be respected.\n\u56de\u590d @EdKrassen @BWay124 The answer isn\u2019t always the extreme opposite. Yet you do this all the time.\n\u56de\u590d @TalbertSwan I find that bishop is in the title of your name. Have you ever said anything about love my neighbor? It seems like you hate white people. I\u2019m not white. I\u2019m Hispanic. But I can\u2019t get over how much white hate has grown so much.\n\u56de\u590d @wilderpatriot I need help understanding this I thought this ruling was to help protect women\u2019s embryos from negligence cause by the fertility clinic. Because the fertility clinics did not want to be charged to this degree over an accident/negligence they decided to halt IVF. Correct?\n\u56de\u590d @MJTruthUltra Not having to worry about making mortgage payments after the death of your husband must be an amazing release of a major source of stress.\n\u56de\u590d @acnewsitics Couldn\u2019t really tell the camera moved a little too fast.\n\u56de\u590d @guelphgirlchris Is it empty because people can\u2019t afford to buy food?\n\u56de\u590d @Michell33650674 You think people should hate themselves because they\u2019re white? You think people living in large towns are the only ones that should have their lives validated? People are tired of being smeared by people like you.\n\u56de\u590d @DerekNeverFails Did staging it include what happened to a supporter?\n\u56de\u590d @ArtCandee Why would she want to publicly show her support for him? The MSM and social media can rip her to pieces, say every vile thing about her and ask her all kind of disgusting questions. I\u2019m sure you would love that. And to think that all of a sudden the media has done a backflip?\n\u56de\u590d @ChrisDJackson I don\u2019t understand how people can go on and on about how happy they are with Biden being president. The United States has been wrecked and will never be the same. How do people think things are so great?\n\u56de\u590d @moonshynej @jzorich4 @ghelt @krassenstein I did watch the video. I don\u2019t want to start back-and-forth insults. In my tweet, I did not assign blame, who started it or who made it worse. Normally adults, don\u2019t behave this way at work and definitely in front of a camera for the world to see. It should be embarrassing.\n\u56de\u590d @mjfree All of this criticism from him, responding to the crowd without speaking the word I am just because his last name is Trump. And your mind you have imagined that he is a monster. People saying he\u2019s fair game ready to start dragging him through the mud.\n\u56de\u590d @SarahisCensored @JoJoFromJerz Trashing Trump is cash cow. So many people are taking advantage of this. Some of them make are making a lot of money.\n\u56de\u590d @TheGeneral_0 I know things are different post Covid. If you don\u2019t have Covid, you might have to tough it out. I am retired but when I worked, I hardly missed a day my entire working life, 40 years. Because I had a child there was no way I was going to get fired. I dragged myself to work.\n\u56de\u590d @TalbertSwan This was started by Joe Biden when he announced that he was going to pick a vice president that was a specific race and gender. He wasn\u2019t the only one that said that. Then he said it would be someone that would be qualified as well. Blame him.\n\u56de\u590d @Dentonandsas @mmpadellan Awful people.\n\u56de\u590d @ArtCandee @mmpadellan He added, that conclusion does not appear in my report. Why is it people have to watch hours of something to hear for themselves the truth while others just post half truths.\n\u56de\u590d @LqLana 2 party system no longer works. Eventually we have to have a third party.

The media won\u2019t talk about these things either. Although I wouldn\u2019t have used the F word.

All these reasons that you give for this or that or looking at things from different angles.

Ng\u0101 mihi\".  @peoplemakeGLA @clydegateway\nLovely to have a day off - wild garlic picking, walk in Carronbridge, and a visit to the lovely Garden of Cosmic Speculation. A joy for all the senses. https://t.co/WKTdD3amUU\n\u56de\u590d @RWFMuseum @ARAScot Interesting - do you know where that rhetorical question stemmed from? It's also featured on anti-suffrage postcards made by commercial publishers pre-WW1, for example in illustrations where they are being carted off to prison!\nToday @womenslibrary team members presented achievements, reflections and learning from our amazing 'Three Decades of Changing Minds' project, funded by @HeritageFundSCO Thank you to everyone who came along from across various sectors and funding organisations #GWLat30 https://t.co/8KsvuanvmA\n\u56de\u590d @womanandsphere @womenslibrary We do exhibit these particular coins as fakes to make exactly that point. So the interpretation in the exhibition makes that clear - it\u2019s obvious when you look at them as well!\nThe @GIfestival offerings @womenslibrary include a beautiful exhibition by Zana Araki, which you can read more about here: https://t.co/KXTo2ZABUK Zana is one of three artists being showcased at Glasgow Women's Library, along with Yoko Ono and Reiko Goto Collins. Don't miss it! https://t.co/RoPCQQkLHW\nNew set of Blogs from @DrAdelePatrick - Thoughtful, varied, insightful, generous, hopeful. Always something to learn.  \"This compelling urge to demonstrate our busyness I think is linked to ideas of worth and the need to demonstrate our value to others\".  https://t.co/H9J757D4nn\nWe are so pleased to welcome @SaraNAhmed to @womenslibrary - don't miss this chance! Sara Ahmed: Killjoys on Tour | Glasgow Women's Library https://t.co/BUljnT1TFU\nThank you @artfund and @NationalGallery for a truly lovely evening last night in celebration of #MuseumOfTheYear - congratulations to all the finalists: @SkiptonTownHall @DCAdundee @McrMuseum @NPGLondon and of course to the winner, @young_vam \ud83c\udf7e\ud83e\udd42\nI loved visiting @MuseumoftheHome this week. So  much  to  see,  and themes  so beautifully curated and tenderly interpreted include young carers and people missing from home. And of course feminism\u2026 https://t.co/eXXF0CurRo\n\u56de\u590d @JamesJonesGroup Dear @JamesJonesGroup Please can you help @womenslibrary? We need woodchips for our new garden in the East End of Glasgow. We're a charity and the only Accredited Museum of women's history in the whole of the UK.

Amazingly charming and informative staff.\u201d  @womenslibrary #GWLat30\nSome high profile defamation cases of late. Defamation is a serious issue and I'm noticing that some people seem to feel more entitled, particularly on social media, to say whatever they like, even when it's lies. Screenshots are really important to take and file in this regard.\n\u56de\u590d @Finn_Mackay It's a classic!\n\u56de\u590d @BrackeAnne Thanks Maud!\nLast chance to see this brilliant exhibition @womenslibrary - ends on 31st May!

We have such a thriving cultural sector - welcome!   Thank you also for recognising @womenslibrary - the only Accredited Museum of women's history in the UK - in this recent Motion:   https://t.co/D80AHZwumx\n\u56de\u590d @JennyLConstable @alisonthewliss @JohnSwinney @theSNP I'm SO sorry that @alisonthewliss will no longer be my MP due to boundary changes. She's truly an excellent MP: always there in the Chamber long after most MPs have left debates, reads everything diligently, represents all her constituents equally and committed to social justice.\nA real pleasure to welcome Scotland's Minister for Culture, Europe and International Development, @kaukabstewart, to @womenslibrary this morning. She presented a framed copy of the Motion she submitted to Parliament marking our exhibition of Maud Joachim's hunger strike medal. https://t.co/IlGwVuXcJr\nSome reading ideas and recommendations from @womenslibrary volunteers: New fiction | Glasgow Women's Library https://t.co/mED18uH2SL\n\u56de\u590d @macinnes_neil @ScotlandNT @heraldscotland @ScottishFA @CelticFC Do bob into @womenslibrary if you have time Neil - I'm not working this weekend, but you could make a wish for Yoko's Wish Tree and see our exhibitions!

UK doesn\u2019t deserve them.\n\u56de\u590d @freedom_007__ @AgathedeLili They offered to give up their titles. The Queen said no. Even if they take the titles the world will still call Harry Prince Harry! Meghan has her own title now! You clowns think taken away their titles will help the RF. Harry and Meghan have transcended them\n\u56de\u590d @JSJdarling Treat Kate nice! This nasty piece of work is to try and distract from the missing future Queen.

However the commander in chief not attending St Paul\u2019s is an insult to veterans. @RoyalFamily Also giving William Harry\u2019s titles while he is promoting veterans is petty.

Lawfare is the point of this, not justice.\n\u56de\u590d @POTUS Your undercutting of Israel means Hamas won't take any ceasefires that requires any hostage release. Your foreign policy weakness is encouraging Iran and our other enemies. It's pointless anyway. Israel can ignore you because you can't cut aid. Congress will never allow it.\n\u56de\u590d @WalshFreedom @BasedMikeLee Trump hurt your pride and now you're just bitter. This isn't about Trump or Mike Lee, this is about you and your hatred controlling you. Might want to fix that. I don't like Trump that much either, but he's not what you portray him to be either. And he's still better than Biden.\n\u56de\u590d @WalshFreedom @POTUS It wasn't really the right place for a campaign speech. Delivery wasn't horrible considering the low bar. The poop-my-pants face and pose weren't exactly awe-inspiring. Honestly, if I was our enemies he'd make me giggle, not quake - which is a major problem.\n\u56de\u590d @KamalaHarris Stop spending so much and then everyone can have lower taxes. The villains aren't rich people. The bad guys  are those in Congress and in the White House that have zero financial responsibility.\n\u56de\u590d @JDCocchiarella No one really believes she's capable of doing this, right?\n\u56de\u590d @WalshFreedom Sometimes they really are out to get you. Trump isn't wrong. He's been hounded and chased since he became president like none other before him, even W. He had the best economy of any president ever his first two years and you still won't give him credit for it.\n\u56de\u590d @SenatorDurbin What insurrection? Using that label for an unarmed protest that lasted a few hours and did little damage is just political propaganda. The BLM riots were far more violent and did much more damage yet few of those who participated were every hunted or held \"accountable.\"\n\u56de\u590d @RepJeffries There was no violent insurrection. There wasn't even a non-violent insurrection. There was a riot, and aside from a few rabble rousers, most of them simply walked through the capitol like sightseers on a tour. You simply want to be divisive and can't be trusted to make policy.\n\u56de\u590d @HRHBethany @WalshFreedom Come on, democrats love riots. Of course, there were no city blocks burning or small businesses looted, so it\u2019s more of an amateur event. But you have to give them an A for effort. The Right just isn\u2019t used to embracing violence- err, peaceful protesting- as well as the Left is.\n\u56de\u590d @GovLarryHogan lol, no. Just no. This pretty much proves that you can't get justice in NY if the Democrat machine doesn't want you to. No way in hell I'd ever set foot in that state. If they can do this to Trump, a former president and a wealthy man, what chance do the rest of us have?\n\u56de\u590d @NAACP There are so many successful young Black folks you can put forward as great role models and you instead choose to highlight this guy? You are part of the problem.\n\u56de\u590d @WalshFreedom This shows a complete ignorance of history. Despite modern pretenses, the SC has never been apolitical or unbiased. The earliest justices were openly political, in fact. To pretend that the folks who end up on the court would do so without bias is just naive.\n\u56de\u590d @ShaykhSulaiman I think it's more likely they are being beaten for assaulting cops and resisting arrest - two things that never work out well. Also, two things that don't garner a lot of sympathy from most law-abiding Americans.\n\u56de\u590d @clairecmc This is exactly what makes Democrats bad for democracy. They want to shut down any ideas not their own, and debate that doesn't line up with their own beliefs, and any people that don't toe the party line. The GOP is a mess, but nothing about them is undemocratic.\n\u56de\u590d @ShaykhSulaiman Arrests aren't deaths. You whine when they're killed and you whine when they aren't killed. I'm beginning to think you're just a whiner in general.\n\u56de\u590d @Slate Do you guys ever get serious?\n\u56de\u590d @dancohen3000 Were they under fire while trying to withdraw? Were Hamas and other Palestinians firing on them from behind civilians? What do you expect them to do?\n\u56de\u590d @mehdirhasan Turns out it wasn't Israel. It was Hamas - again. Not sure why folks keep falling for this. It's always Hamas. They can't help themselves.

They care nothing for the lives and suffering of others, they are secretly corrupt and i wouldn't put it past him to be taking money from the CCP in under the table\n\u56de\u590d @benonwine I'm more worried about the evangelical Christians who are currently trying their hardest to destroy civilization all to bring some prophecy from a book to reality by starting a great war in the middle east and potentially killing everyone\n\u56de\u590d @TIME He\u2019s learning from Putin, first trick the people into believing you\u2019re their savior, then demonize the opposition through false flags. It\u2019s clear day that this was a plant.\n\u56de\u590d @IndoPac_Info Its like Imperial Japan all over again, one Asian nation gets a powerful military and they think to themselves 'we are superior so we should subjegate these savages by force, the world belongs to us'.\n\u56de\u590d @Wario64 Someone at Sony fck up Im guessing.

Just because you have corruption in the US government which needs to be fixed, doesn't some how make the RU and CHN suddenly the good guys. Research their deeds\n\u56de\u590d @krassenstein It is an open secret that Republicans true goals have always been power, so they dumb down the education system and slowly turn Americans into cattle instead of clearing thinking humans. They want to build a fascist government where they rule and not democracy.\n\u56de\u590d @screentime @nytimes Northrop Gruman destroyed Boein after it was acquired by Boein. I hope Sony doesn't end up the same by acquiring Hollywood produtions and getting a flood of woke activists that will ruin their company and flood their future exclusives with garbage agenda laced messaging\n\u56de\u590d @Grummz The fact that the naked skin suit and the bikini is in the game should be the first clue that they didn't censor the game. The second is the fact that the censored bunny suit has a intricate design for the new black cleavage cover rather than a lazy piece of cloth.\n\u56de\u590d @BBCWorld Biden already said he would go to war with China over Taiwan so not him.

We have failed to understand culture and human psychology of the Chinese. They made a vow to exact revenge on Japan and the west for things we did to them no matter what. \"A 100yrs is not too late for vengeance\".\n\u56de\u590d @BBCWorld Good, at least there are people in the government with common sense. Iran isn't hamas who only possess bottle rockets. They have a ton of ballistic missiles and hypersonics that can destroy American ships. We do not want to mess with them without a concrete plan.\n\u56de\u590d @BBCWorld Invading someone's country, stealing their land, oppressing their people, starving them to the point of genocide, and then when they resist you label them as terrorists and portray the evil oppressors as the good guys while vilifying the heroes who are fighting back bravely.\n\u56de\u590d @GeneralMCNews Short term arrogant rightwing thinking will lead to this country's downfall.

I have zero doubt that if it was Trump and one of his sons had done something way worst like murder, he would instantly pardon him like the criminal despot he is.\n\u56de\u590d @DavidSacks Appeasement and diplomacy is why Russia and China have gotten so powerful and are legitimate threats to us now. We wouldn't be wasting trillions of tax payer's money on defense if they simply weren't around today. Its better to simply wipe them all out now while we still can\n\u56de\u590d @PicturesFoIder Security guard needs to be in jail, that's assault. Dude was just fooling around, he didn't have the right to resort to violence.\n\u56de\u590d @Newsweek Good, people are finally waking up and realizing that Trump would sell our country out if given a second chance at power. Taiwan would be doomed and our tech industry would lose 40million jobs from lost of semiconductors to the Chinese and the dollar would be be in ruins\n\u56de\u590d @realnikohouse You have to look at the bigger picture.

What do you know about St. Vladimir\u2019s seminary?

Right?\n\u56de\u590d @masonscottcraig Circumcision was not an act of repentance and faith my friend. It was a way to set apart.

Also in the thumbnail trees are bare, it\u2019s summer now trees are full of leaves https://t.co/cYsCe1LGU7\n\u56de\u590d Personally I think in the event that Biden wins his re-election- I think the most presidential thing to do would be to not pardon his son as tough as it is, but Pardon Trump for his federal crime if Trump is convicted.\nDoubt it, I don\u2019t think with the tax money from my paycheck, with the little time I\u2019ve been in the workforce, and small pay I get could afford to build any of these\n\u56de\u590d And he\u2019s doesn\u2019t care about the damage he could do to the GOP, or the country, it\u2019s all a about him and his needs\n\u56de\u590d I mean a lot of narratives on both MAGA &amp; on the Dems are crumbling away or like I said have just completely flipped, it\u2019s really weird. hard to believe the Debate was not even a week ago and the Supreme Court Ruling was just 2 days ago. Very uncharted political drama we are in\nWelp, there\u2019s a very good chance that The next Senator from New Jersey will be the first one from South Jersey since 1955. Andy Kim is from Cherry Hill, Robert Hendrickson (R), that last Senator from South Jersey was a life long Gloucester County resident (Woodbury)\n\u56de\u590d But in 2024; a large army of visible social media trolls &amp; influencers constantly posting &amp; responding can affect &amp; sway some independents and uncommitted voters.\n\u56de\u590d @KRRR7325 @KeeleyFox29 @PhillyPolice Puerto Ricans are born Americans\nNope, at his age and pending the future court cases he\u2019s facing plus some of the potential years imprisonment he\u2019s looking at, winning this election is about him literally fighting for his life.\nThere\u2019s so many ironies about this conviction and so many hypocrites on social media right now talking about this conviction it makes your head spin but I\u2019ll try to list them all..\nYes, very cool lifestyle to be constantly looking over your shoulder for the opps to pop you, or have the f\u00e9d\u00e9rales arrest you , extradite you to the US where you spend the rest of your life in a prison cell the size of a closet in ADX Florence, very cool\n\u56de\u590d but to decrease the tension and division in this political environment, best thing for everyone would be for Biden (if he wins in November) is to pardon Trump if he is convicted in the federal cases he's facing\nSo basically Trumps Camp was a spreading antisemitic jabs at the sitting Governor of Pennsylvania.   Kind of didn\u2019t affect the outcome Though. It now seems pretty obvious that Shapiro and Kamala couldn\u2019t work since Shapiro would be eyeing the Oval Office and overshadowing her.\n\u56de\u590d but they\u2019d be surprised to realize how much their local sheriff and police departments rely on these federal law enforcement agencies for crime lab work, logistical support, not to mention how much difficult it would be to dismantle criminal organizations that cross state lines\nHoly shit, Dallas really could end up surpassing Los Angeles as the 2nd largest metropolitan area in the country during my life time.\n\u56de\u590d @billmacthirteen @KeeleyFox29 @PhillyPolice Puerto Ricans can\u2019t be here illegally\nFunny thing is probably over 60% of Americans couldn\u2019t point to Gaza or Mexico on a map and would perfectly agree that the President of Mexico  should open the border with Gaza.\n\ud83e\udd14 https://t.co/VwSpmgSRBl\n\ud83d\udcaf- lot of respect for Senator Cruz today, he\u2019s kept the partisan bickering out of his social media today which on a day like today as a representative of our Government overseas at this ceremony, it\u2019s important and should be a lesson for members of Congress on both sides\nMore proof that the Democrats still haven\u2019t learned their lessons In 2016 when it comes to how important it is to counter misinformation and propaganda on social media, but nope, they\u2019ve really have done nothing the last 4 years to show they care about winning these arguments\nin an age on social media for young people, it feels like if you say anything positive about Biden you immediately get shouted down by pro-Trump accounts whether they are bots or real users isn\u2019t the point, the Biden Administration isn\u2019t doing anything to counter this.\n\u56de\u590d And I know it\u2019s only the first week of June. I\u2019ve always been a big believer in not really reading into the polls too much until August. But there\u2019s been a consistent pattern of the overall messaging from the Dems and Biden not really reaching young people the past few years\ud83d\udea8\n\u56de\u590d Not to mention, I hope everyone realizes if Trump wins the election, based off 2025; you can pretty mush kiss away the FBI, ATF, &amp; DEA, and hollow out the DOJ and CIA Which i know sounds like a wet dream for right wingers and anti-government crowd\n\u56de\u590d @neoavatara Nick Sirianni is horrible at press conferences and fielding questions, yet during a game he\u2019s one of the greatest coaches in today\u2019s game.\n\u56de\u590d @LinzoavaBush @Satine5E @KeeleyFox29 @PhillyPolice Puerto Ricans are Americans\n\u56de\u590d Also, compared to the summer of 2016 &amp; 2020. I\u2019m happily surprised that despite the rhetoric and division, this election cycle hasn\u2019t had the type of violence (mass shootings, police shootings, riots, etc) as the previous two mentioned in election cycles. Let keep it that way\n\u56de\u590d Best thing you can do on Social Media whether it be Twitter, Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, instead of rolling your eyes at MAGA propaganda post and continue scrolling; engage them, fact check them, give them counter arguments and call them out for spreading lies and propaganda\n\u56de\u590d @ElectionWiz Ok\u2026they did this when Trump was president too. You didn\u2019t see people freaking out then and crying WW3. But hey just keep drinking the cool aid, work yourself up and fall under the spell of the GOP propaganda machine https://t.co/CETDK3RN2w\n\u56de\u590d @Diamondthedave Nah, just GOP Propaganda to get the sheep riled up- here\u2019s the full video they won\u2019t show you https://t.co/Rlhhueshi6", "overlap_score": 0.1455971246768218, "MARITAL": "Never married", "AREA": "Cities", "INCOME": "Middle Income", "RACE": "Hispanic (any race)", "EMPLOYMENT": "Working now", "RELIGIOUS": "No religion", "PARTY": "Democratic Party", "AGE": "Middle-aged (36-65 years old)", "IDEOLOGY": "Liberal", "GENDER": "Male"}, {"user_id": 1220037128, "screen_name": "DebkaLars", "user_at_name": "Debka", "sample_content": "Analysis | Trump goes on a weird riff about acid \u2014 again - The Washington Post.

It's media's strange need to normalize everything the GOP does. 2. Strategically Trump's favored to win, and he's threatening his opponents and media--the threat may be real. 3. Conservative media coverage gets more views, so it's in their interest financially.\n\u56de\u590d @MamaGaylor And having good ol' Joe do a nomination speech, and a few rally appearances would be very helpful as well to a Harris or whomever else.\n\u56de\u590d @ElieNYC She isn\u2019t owed the nomination, she would need to win it. An open convention would give her the opportunity.  The convention process is designed to handle this, and it would make great copy and drama as well. I\u2019ll support her if she gets it, but Pritzker would be my choice.\n\u56de\u590d @BreeNewsome Disagree on this one completely. The US really has no coherent goals at all besides continuing the status quo. Considering the US place in the world as the biggest economy and military, that kind of makes sense.\n\u56de\u590d Remember this is leaving aside any possible bribery from foreign and corporate actors he almost certainly profited from as President. No Saudi/oil money, no money from Russian oligarchs, and no deals he and his family have no doubt cut while he was President. 9/10\n\u56de\u590d A central question would be whether African American voters would rebel if the choice wasn't Harris. Pro-Trump  media and bot farms would stoke this like the Bernie-Bros play they made in 16, or the pro-Hillary PUMAs in 08. Hard not to see this getting ugly.  2/x\n\u56de\u590d @joshtpm They should tell him to drop because any other Dem is stronger if they are simply  anti Trump and smart enough to run on \u201cI\u2019ll maintain Biden policies if elected\u201d \u2026otherwise we have a likely dictatorship in 2025.\n\u56de\u590d @davidfrum The push to have Biden drop seems to be invigorating the anti-Trump alliance. I\u2019m optimistic people will get excited if and when he drops out formally.\nTrump had to come up with 450 million or have assets seized. As time was ticking down his social media company that lost over 58 million last year was merged with a company that was listed on the NASDAQ, and Trump was given ~60% of the shares in the new company. Scam.\n\u56de\u590d @ElieNYC If Biden remains the candidate, his health will be the central issue of the campaign cycle. Not Trump. Not fascism. People know Trump already. Most don't think he's a fascist (he is). The health thing will keep going. It won't stop unless he drops or has an Awakenings recovery.\n\u56de\u590d @benFranklin2018 Sure, but Dems just ditched the biggest liability in Biden's age. Hell, he can even campaign for her a little. And no matter what happens, bad actors will try to inflame a Bernie Bros situation, claiming to be Dems that won't vote for the nominee. That's baked in.\n\u56de\u590d @WajahatAli @denise_dewald This is a good point, but I\u2019d rather go to bat for a capable female minority than a stubborn and confused old white guy who doesn\u2019t know when to get out of the way.\n\u56de\u590d Trump is a notorious liar, obv, and it's very likely he falsely claimed to be a billionaire many times. In fact, when Trump sued a biographer that made this claim, he was forced to abandon the suit before the discovery phase, where the biographer could have proved it. 2/10\nWhat the shit is this? Harris needs to confront him to his face about this.  Of course, he\u2019ll probably just deny he ever said it I suppose.\n\u56de\u590d @BreeNewsome Like the whole debt thing. On a personal level it isn't that anyone really desires you are in debt, it's just a lack of caring that most are in debt and need to be to function in this society.\n\u56de\u590d @emptywheel The money was to Trump, Kushner is a cutout?  Does Kushner really control have anything but nominal control over that money? It's the Trump family the Saudis gave the money to. Saying it's an investment in Kushner fund, is window dressing.\nComplete failure by the @nytimes .   He said his supporters wouldn\u2019t have to vote after this election\u2026how is this not the most significant statement made in presidential politics ever??\n\u56de\u590d @benFranklin2018 Some just think he's too old and it's a liability. That's me, at least. Not paid by anyone. Voted for Biden in 2020, and will again in 2024 if he doesn't drop.\n\u56de\u590d @SpyTalker @NormOrnstein @CarolLeonnig Reminder: The Saudi Sovereign Wealth Fund ?invested? 2 billion supposedly in Kushner. They GAVE Trumps family 2 billion! The guy who Trump put on the WH payroll, married to his daughter/Trump VP/also paid WH advisor. Looks like a bad attempt at a cutout to me.\n\u56de\u590d @yaneerbaryam I'm not doing raw milk, but until someone finds pasteurization doesn't work, ie they're able to culture replicating virus from it, I'm not at all worried.\n\u56de\u590d @TheRickWilson Isn\u2019t running to end elections basically just seditious by definition?\nDems need to make impeaching Thomas a part of their party platform this year. The problem is it will seem to many a political ploy to get Dobbs overturned, and not in response to his corruption. Committing to non-partisan commission of judges to chose his replacement might work.\nTrump's latest scam is Trump Media going public. Somehow the bullshit snake oil company that was losing money as Truth Social merged with a shell company and magically got valuated and allowed to trade on NASDAQ. Trump's stake is now worth more than 5 billion.\n\u56de\u590d @JournalistJG @RBReich I support a government run lottery, but agree that advertising isn't needed.\n\u56de\u590d @ElieNYC It will be the most consequential convention since at least 1980...can't blame them.  But, also need to be careful as bad actors will use this to flame \"they didn't pick X so now I'm staying home\" stuff....a la the Bernie Bros play in 2016.\n\u56de\u590d @davetroy @GaryMarcus I think I'm more optimistic than you on AI. Seems like just more transistors, more bandwidth, and bigger data sets has been the secret sauce to date. Obv. silicon and traditional computing isn't super efficient at this stuff, but we're seeing rapid advancements for now.\nLook, I sure hope Biden steps down. Not that it's an auto win...the Right and mainstream media will have a field day with Harris as prosecutor, a black lady, etc. It's going to be brutal...but at least it will be something to fight for.\n\u56de\u590d @MamaGaylor @POTUS @JoeBiden I don't know what that is.\n\u56de\u590d @RBReich Problem is illegal lotteries fill the void if the state doesn't run them.   Agree with your points, but think a state regulated lottery is best--certainly could be made better.\n\u56de\u590d @digby56 This is correct, but as long as Biden is in it, the race will be about two geriatric white guys, both of whom are completely out of touch.

Third, we estimated the mortality of hospitalised patients using data from published cohorts.\u201d \ud83d\ude44\n\u56de\u590d The 5k/day doesn\u2019t include air, sea, or northern border. Will we simply be shifting the volume to other locations? This bill is nothing more than a multi billion dollar bandaid. Meanwhile in MA, we\u2019ll be spending $1B over the next yr while reducing funding for essential services https://t.co/GigXlMaYaJ\n\u56de\u590d @boston25 They kept Caritas Carney hospitals open for an additional 14 yrs after they were about to go under and many (including Obama) lauded de la Torre for his commitment to \u201caffordable care\u201d. Funny how many forget.   https://t.co/5MumT9RJKx\n\u56de\u590d @MassFiscal So, will the children be enrolled in Lexington schools? Top district in our state. Once they\u2019re enrolled aren\u2019t we obligated to keep them in Lexington?  I sure hope Lexington welcomes them with open arms.\n\u56de\u590d @BillWeinsteinOH @BrentAWilliams2 @MixyPisa Gender (sex) is not a social construct - gender specific stereotypes are.\n\u56de\u590d @RepJayapal How do you know if noncitizens are voting in federal elections if you don\u2019t require ID? In MA I guess that wouldn\u2019t even matter since everyone is able to obtain a driver\u2019s license AND there\u2019s no difference between a citizen vs noncitizen license.\n\u56de\u590d @Jaime_ASantos @USAGym was not the respondent to Barbosu\u2019s appeal. FIG was therefore, FIG is permitted to provide evidence which they did.\n\u56de\u590d @ajlamesa \u201cThey believe the president\u2019s record on climate change can boost his popularity with young voters.\u201d What has this lifelong politician actually changed for the better? It\u2019s all \u2018a billion here\u2019 and a \u2018trillion there\u2019 but just like with ARPA and education, zero results.\n\u56de\u590d No clear process outline in FIG Technical Rules for coaches to request review of Superior Jury for line judgements. This is a gap however as a coach, Camelia should have sought clarification and clear guidelines prior to competition. So this is on both.\n\u56de\u590d @TracyExplains This occurs with influenza and every other airborne respiratory illness. What\u2019s so fantastic about bodily autonomy is that you can choose to wear a properly fitted N95 and to get vaccinated as many times as you like. Lyles gets to compete &amp; you get to feel safe. Win/win.\n\u56de\u590d @TheYoungJurks His last livestream made it clear that he couldn\u2019t care less about the truth. Does he really believe that the defense didn\u2019t subpoena cell phones/location data? THEN he pretends as if the request wasn\u2019t blocked by Judge Cannone.\n\u56de\u590d \u201cHamas wants its people, including &amp; perhaps especially its children, to die. And it wants those deaths to be photographed, &amp; to circulate throughout the world. The depravity of this is difficult, perhaps impossible, to comprehend.\u201d\nThere are numerous people who oppose both Trump &amp; the new border bill. Stop using Trump as an excuse for trying to cram 5k encounters per DAY &amp; billions in foreign aid down our throats. The &gt;5k per day we\u2019ve experienced for the past 3 yrs is a direct product of Biden\u2019s policies. https://t.co/VhEOb9rIw3\n\u56de\u590d @DrJBhattacharya All complete frauds.   https://t.co/8Yj9Xyhw1M\n\u56de\u590d @JenniferSey But at least NEA and AFT got rid of DeVos \ud83d\ude44  https://t.co/YQJR2laB9t\n\u56de\u590d @KamalaHarris She had sepsis due to an incomplete miscarriage. Remember this when they say that mifepristone is completely safe and should be available over-the-counter. Either it\u2019s safe and women can \u201cmiscarry\u201d at home OR there is a risk.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t ignore it,\u201d said Boston City Councilman Ed Flynn. \u201cDrug transactions taking place, crime, and we also know there is human trafficking taking place.\u201d  Flynn represents the Boston Common area, telling Boston 25 News he\u2019s seen the change downtown over the past three years.\n\u56de\u590d @ReadTheLion Not surprising. https://t.co/xh6Ksk5mV0\n\u56de\u590d @SenatorSinema 1) Who determines if DHS has capacity required to reopen border? What are metrics being used?  2) Current US Immigration Law already contains requirements for timely processing.  3) In the end, they still have up to a year to apply for asylum. Most don\u2019t. How will this change?\nDid we ever hit 150,000 southern border encounters per month (5k per day) before Biden took office? If not, why should we agree that 5k is the new normal?\n\u56de\u590d @CynicallyOptim2 @Aww_Schmidt @KelleyKga No. The rest of their generation did NOT have the same experience. The private  school down the street reopened FT in Sept of 2020 while our district remained closed until they were mandated to reopen in late April of 2021. 1/\n\u56de\u590d @BillKristol If they really cared, they would\u2019ve presented separate legislation. We were well under 5k encounters per day before Biden took office &amp; we should be under 5k again. HR 2 provides funding for increased staffing &amp; tech. It was passed in the House. Why is the Senate sitting on it?\n\u56de\u590d @thompson_marv @AConcernedPare2 @geniuswaitres23 Perhaps you can explain how teachers in Lexington, MA (on average) are paid less than teachers in Boston yet student outcomes are vastly different. Why should an exemplary teacher in Boston be paid the same or even less than a sub-par teacher in the next classroom? https://t.co/exLO4C8vvE\n\u56de\u590d @Jimmyspolitics @stevemur @GS02787498 @kristenmag @GovInslee No. Learning on-line requires reliable wi-fi, 1:1 devices, real-time IT support, in-person learning coaches to ensure students remain on-task, real-time additional instructional support when necessary, physical environment conducive for learning, ADA compliant accommodations, etc\n\u56de\u590d @7News Somerville and Northampton - both self-proclaimed sanctuary cities, both zero\n\u56de\u590d @FortPointer 2023 - misplaced documentation verifying the safety of the tracks. Tell me again how it\u2019s not a management issue.   https://t.co/61MKYcTPNv\n\u56de\u590d @franklylizajane @kmkeirns @thesarabear CAS didn\u2019t strip anyone of the Bronze. They explicitly stated that\u2019s out of their jurisdiction. FIG refused and OSOPC couldn\u2019t even be bothered to attend virtually.\n\u56de\u590d @itsjustclutter @TheGymQuinn It\u2019s a moot point because it\u2019s not a required element of an application per CAS rules. They may request it on the form because it saves them time but it\u2019s not required.  And really, perhaps it is best left up to the Panel to determine. https://t.co/KIiMMN57o9\n\u56de\u590d @bosnianbabe89 @NemoNullius17 @HattieMags You really believe that social media is solely responsible for mental health decline &amp; that school closures didn\u2019t exacerbate the issue? Are you really saying that school closures didn\u2019t increase the use of social media as children sought different ways to interact w/their peers?", "overlap_score": 0.1789964666422376, "MARITAL": "Married", "AREA": "Cities", "INCOME": "High Income", "RACE": "White Alone", "EMPLOYMENT": "Working now", "RELIGIOUS": "Christianity", "PARTY": "Republican Party", "AGE": "Middle-aged (36-65 years old)", "IDEOLOGY": "Liberal", "GENDER": "Female"}, {"user_id": 1259231416790978560, "screen_name": "ActorsPanel", "user_at_name": "Filipino Hollywood Actors Panel", "sample_content": "#ComingSoon A teaser for \"Descendants: The Rise of Red\" starring our 10th Filipino Hollywood Actors Panelist (2023) Sam Morelos on Disney+.

It's the Crux of the issue. The procedure change hasn't just happened because the NHS felt like it. It's happened because in medicine and standard of care once a mistake happens or some systemic issues that puts people at risk is revealed, things get changed to improve care-\n\u56de\u590d @JOhnnyboy12x12 @Cooperstreaming Self id doesn't even pertain to entry of spaces, so you really don't know a damn thing just what propaganda you've been fed.\n\u56de\u590d @samspeakssense @AlexSmith90014 @sally_hines @AngelaRayner @UKLabour No woman speaks for any other women. More women are accepting of trans people than aren't. Trans people have used women's spaces for decades without issue. You want to cause harm to trans people by forcing them to conform to their sex at birth regardless of what other changes-\n\u56de\u590d @encino_fan @SerpentTyrnfae @MadisonRaeGun @ZoAndBehold -whether or not gender dysphoria is a biological condition that can be neurologically scanned for or not has no bearing. If a person would be happier as X gender, then they should be allowed to be X gender without having to prove some sort of pathology. Why would you need to?\n\u56de\u590d @lulusolomo86641 @alley_robin_ @ap_schulz @QueenMab87 \"not to their advantage to blow women out of the water\" you're claiming they held back, even against eachother, who supposedly is also supposed to be better than any woman can be?\n\u56de\u590d @Sjg3G @spe88308 @JolyonMaugham No more like 1 suicide per 5 years to 5 suicides per year. That's a 20 times increase in suicides, predicated around a singular event (2021 tavistock Vs bell). It's pretty damn clear.\n\u56de\u590d @DisBritney @MedicTrommasher That middle finger is clearly disproportionate to the rest of the hand with the length and width\n\u56de\u590d @cyber_wolf35 @ap_schulz @QueenMab87 @lulusolomo86641 Define \"large portion\" and if they won by insurmountable margins? And then that's still almost 2 decades for 5-AR athletes to rise through the ranks and develop their craft.\n\u56de\u590d @Ilikeottersbest @PinkNews -criminal minority of that demographic.\n\u56de\u590d @Freda_Media Free speech is one thing, but libel is something else. That as a statement wasn't made as an opinion, it was an accusation. So it could very well be sued over Imo. Cause America is also well known as a place easy to sue other people into silence.\n\u56de\u590d @lizabetty89 @yea_karen53 @MeowMeow4M4A @AidanTheJester @BriannaWu You mean, effects on their body, from the hormone cycle they have, based upon the primary androgen (estrogen) which occur cyclically, on a monthly period? And you're wanting to say that isn't the same thing as pms (which is caused by the hormone cycle) just because they're amab?\n\u56de\u590d @VoterScumbag @Jaceriley393 @GodsOwnProtoype @Cooperstreaming -identification of belonging to a certain demographic minority/protected characteristic.\n\u56de\u590d @AfternoonTune The \"every conservative accusation is an admission\" holds true when they try and deny and minimise bigotry.\n\u56de\u590d @seanhiruki @suzu_vespaa @ShitpostGate That's what that specific translation says tho.\n\u56de\u590d @wiseintheways @CloverSevenLeaf Either you think sex is determined by phenotype at birth, or you think sex is determined by phenotype at birth *in most cases* and if it's the latter and you are willing to make exceptions, you have to explain why you won't make the same exceptions for trans people.\n\u56de\u590d @Ilikeottersbest @PinkNews Trans women account for 0.25% of the population, they are also a minority. Conflating trans women with men is ridiculous. Trans women using women's bathrooms is not the same as a predatory man trying to SA. And no you can't always tell who's trans and who's not.\n\u56de\u590d @ap_schulz @QueenMab87 @lulusolomo86641 Why are you being prejudiced against people with dsd/intersex? Women with conditions that raise their testosterone levels in line with typical male levels are still healthy.\n\u56de\u590d @Ilikeottersbest @PinkNews Except all males don't identify as women. You're using a strawman that men identify as women to be able to hurt women in women's spaces. The frequency of that happening is so rare that it's no where near a legitimate concern.  Women aren't less safe with trans women included\n\u56de\u590d @KirstiMiller30 Now I will add this wording is probably such a minor thing that even the law wouldn't use it to say a woman wasn't guilty of any offence, and that women can be charged with any offence (bar rape) in the sexual offences act. However I still think it's an unnecessary gendered term\n\u56de\u590d @SianHerfield @ruskienboots @JamesFr87139374 @MonosoUpNorth There are first hand accounts from many trans people that show it actually does. Just because it's not a main listed effect of transition doesn't mean to say that it doesn't happen to some.\n\u56de\u590d @wiseintheways @PsychoJoshGTS @Foxy_KB_ @CloverSevenLeaf Except self id doesn't govern access to any women's spaces.\n\u56de\u590d @Cynthior1 Where's the proof? XY doesn't always mean someone is a male. Imane Khelif is a woman who was born a female. If she does have an intersex disorder, that doesn't mean she isn't a woman.\n\u56de\u590d @branwen41677029 @rogdmum A male dsd, doesn't mean she isn't a woman. \"If not about unfair advantage\" because the climate of gender politics is what it is they just assume without any proof or testing that it gives unfair advantage. Idk how being raised may affect it but it might. Due to being that in 2-\n\u56de\u590d @Gablesgreen134 @AndrewB_UK @halfironmum @MichelleAlleva @Rebecca_Stanton @NadiaWhittomeMP Actually it's not. Women are the driving force of trans inclusion, more women accept trans people than don't, and more women accept trans people than men.

As she pulled away, she smiled softly.  \u201cI am? Well, I am very glad to hear that. Because I do not want to let any perfumed lady steal you away from me.\u201d\nSettling by his side, a smile on her lips.  \u201cYes. I managed to borrow it from the Castle Library. I don\u2019t think the sheriff will miss it.\n\u56de\u590d @FortifiedSister Hearing the whisper, Lizzie opened her eyes just enough to see Florence.  It broke her heart to see her eyes so puffy from tears. Her older sister, so hurt.  Part of her wanted to chase Guy with her bow, just to scare him.  Giving her a small nod in response, Lizzie offered her +\n\u201cA poet? Only for you, though.\u201d  Moving her fingers to gently run through his hair, Lizzie smiled softly at him.  \u201cThe Earl and the Archer . . . It has a nice ring to it, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d\nPlaying with the tag Florence returned to her. A gift that she\u2019d held close to her heart when she\u2019d been a teenager who ran to the woods. A girl who believed Outlaws could be heroes.\n\u201cHave some cake. Today is about you.\u201d  And she wanted her sister to feel loved and appreciated more than anything today.\n\u201cThe bastard, I\u2019m going to kill him.\u201d  She\u2019d get her bow and threaten the man herself later. A hand reached out to run her fingers against her neck gently.\nSwitching it out for her bible.  She\u2019s a holy woman after all.\n\u56de\u590d @FortifiedSister + a half smile, tentatively reaching her hand across the two little ones.  \u201cMhmm. Tired but awake.\u201d  And thankfully, they hadn\u2019t had any visitors in the night.  Right when she thought peace and quiet had settled, there was a bang on the door downstairs.  \u201c. . . Who is here so +\n\u56de\u590d @FortifiedSister Lizzie was shaking slightly.   Whether it was in panic or anger, she didn\u2019t quite know. It was likely a mixture of both.  As the dagger clattered to the floor, Lizzie took the opportunity to back the butcher up, putting space between him and her sister. Her arrow was still +\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell Guy.\u201d  Still, she was beaming from ear to ear, a laugh leaving her lips.\n\u201cShe has heeded your damn warnings! Carlos leaves Nottingham soon, and I will never see him again!\u201d  Neither was she.  \u201cYou are a fool, Guy Of Gisborne if you believe I will let you abandon this family and leave my sister to be treated like shit for the rest of her life.\u201d\nShe does heed his warnings, far more than Lizzie does.  Having a family doesn\u2019t make him weak.  Would he truly leave Florence ruined in the eyes of the world? Would he do that to the woman who loves him more than life itself?\n\u201cYour Majesty. Again, I am so sorry.\u201d  It was reflex. Even though Lizzie did not fear the sheriff in Nottingham, she understood the power of authority.  At the end of the day, she was a baker\u2019s daughter and she had made a mistake before the king.\n\u201cWe know how to pick the right men, don\u2019t we?\u201d  Despite the teasing grin on her lips, this was clearly lighthearted.\nThe butcher who has been continuously hounding Florence for a marriage between his son and Lizzie.

But she wouldn\u2019t say that now. It wasn\u2019t fair on Florence.  Taking Evelyn gently from her sister, she set the toddler on her lap, offering her sister her hand.\n\u201cThe Bastile?\u201d  Suddenly, she felt even more out of place. Lizzie had spent so long trying to prepare for this trip, and yet, she was well aware how she stuck out. How clear it was that she was a peasant girl at heart.  \u201cHampton Court?

We get rid of them and he\u2019ll still blame you.\u201d  Brows furrowed, Lizzie looked to the pile of coins.  \u201cGet Egg and Mary and pack a bag. Just past the clearing in Sherwood, there\u2019s a twisted oak. You\u2019ll find Robin and the outlaws around there.\u201d\nQuick to move to steady him, Lizzie frowned and furrowed her brows.  \u201cAre you certain you\u2019ll be alright? We can stay inside instead.\u201d  Concern was evident in her expression.\n\u201c. . . No, never. I have never had the time to have a crush, I guess.\u201d  And she had been sheltered by her sister from the harassment other young women her age experienced.  \u201cI\u2019m foolish, aren\u2019t I?

It\u2019s also true that it took immense organizing &amp; sacrifice to curb BJP power.  And it\u2019ll make a difference. So many voices on the ground, including Muslims, Dalits, Sikhs, Christians, workers &amp; rural\u2026\nOf course the U.S. wants to sanction the ICC.  Biden and Blinken fear they could be targeted next - and, indeed, they should.   They\u2019re co conspirators and enablers of the Gaza genocide.\nDems should have an open convention, rather than pre-selecting a candidate.  Caucus, listen, learn &amp; choose a candidate.  But Dems won\u2019t do this because they\u2019re too institutionally conservative &amp; afraid of uncertainty.  Now is the time to build something new.\nIt\u2019s stunning to still see so many people trying to police campus speech &amp; protest, all whilst a genocide is unfolding in real time and broadcast to the world.\nIsraeli security forces sneaked into Al-Nuseirat refugee camp through a humanitarian aid truck.  They retrieved 4 hostages, but murdered 150 Palestinians &amp; injured hundreds more.  Nothing about this is normal or lawful.  The depth of the war crimes are more shocking by the day.\nA lot of criticism about protesters wearing masks. Here\u2019s a counter take:  * we live in a fundamentally different moment, where your identity can be followed for all time on the basis of a single act or photo  * anonymity has a long &amp; storied role in American history  * there\u2019s\u2026\nOur universities are more interested in brutalizing and suspending their own students, than criticizing the war criminals waging genocide in Gaza, and the U.S. government which continues to fund it.\nNetanyahu should be cuffed and on trial for war crimes, not meeting with lawmakers and addressing Congress.\nModi addressing the nation. He\u2019ll claim victory, but it\u2019s a massive defeat.   The BJP dictatorship, with Modi as authoritarian leader, is losing its grasp.  Change is afoot in India &amp; forces of democracy are stirring.  First order of business: release all the political prisoners.\nWho\u2019s braver?  The people under the lights in the arena yelling they want to save democracy from Trump?  Or the protesters outside the arena facing the police demanding an end to a genocide that has taken 40k lives.  Power exists in America. You just have to know where to look.\nWhen Palestinians, int\u2019ll orgs, local journalists &amp; human rights advocates told you Israel is engaging in widespread torture, you denied it.  Israeli whistleblowers now report that Palestinian detainees are stripped, blindfolded, with all 4 limbs shackled.  Do you believe us now?\nIt\u2019s taken decades &amp; generations to create international law as we know it today.  Now Israel &amp; the U.S. want to rewrite it, at precisely the moment we need it most.\nAn extraordinary individual, @imraansiddiqi , is running for Congress.  Imraan has long documented hate in America, contributed to the struggle for racial justice &amp; advocated for Palestinian human rights.  Please spread the word &amp; support his campaign.  https://t.co/54qXCoZwWh\nNo Palestinian is safe in Gaza.  There is no safe place in Gaza.  These are the facts. Everything else is mythology and propaganda.\nHere's the truth about Indian democracy.  It's no democracy at all. It's an authoritarian state that preys on minorities, journalists &amp; human rights defenders.   India is threat to its own people &amp; the entire world. https://t.co/7JTZSbHoIP\nWe are witnessing a triumph of international law.  The process can be political &amp; enforcement limited.  But when South Africa charges Israel with genocide, backed by evidence in a global forum, it carries immense moral and persuasive clarity.  Israel has never been more alone.\nBREAKING: Netanyahu tells us what we knew all along. He is dedicated to the ethnic cleansing &amp; genocide of the Palestinian people.\nThe world will never forget Israel\u2019s atrocities in Gaza. Not today, tomorrow or ever.  We will remember the unspeakable horrors they perpetrated, their dehumanizing rhetoric to justify it and their authoritarian tactics to silence those who spoke out.\n\u201cWe must continue our organizing and advocacy efforts in the U.S. as well, where the long arm of Hindutva continues to spread through the rewriting of textbooks, intimidation and lawfare efforts against U.S. based activists and advocacy organizations, transnational repression\u2026 https://t.co/ErmGCaRkuZ\nChristians in India today face discrimination, hate &amp; even mob lynchings.  Finally their counterparts in the US are waking up to this reality.   The United Methodist Church just passed a resolution condemning Hindutva nationalism.  https://t.co/3TB0wDjmxM\nMore than 1,700 pro Palestinian student protesters have been arrested in recent weeks.  Amnesty for all. Their only crime is the conviction of their beliefs.\nJosh Shapiro is terrible on Gaza.  He\u2019s expressed unconditional support for Netanyahu despite evidence of genocide, targeted pro Palestinian students &amp; continues to equate criticism of Israel with anti Semitism.
