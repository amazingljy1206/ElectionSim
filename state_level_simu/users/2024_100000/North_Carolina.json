And how he was murdered for talking about his experiences\n\u56de\u590d @FREEL0LA @greenbaggg @jqueenin___ @atlslugga Exactly\u2026he responds to her voice, never to faces, because he can\u2019t see faces\u2026he can hear,but can\u2019t see. That\u2019s why he never grabs for things around him. He never focuses on toys. He couldn\u2019t grab the spoon, because he doesn\u2019t see or recognize food\u2026.and he\u2019s only had a bottle.\n\u56de\u590d @ChriseanJunior No disrespect, Jr\u2026.you\u2019re gonna have to just sit there and wait on CPS\u2026or the Lord\u2026.and try to use Morse Code with your eyes, to communicate to your fans to send you more milk..so you can have more than one bottle a day. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffd\n\u56de\u590d @BritttWill Oooomgggg..we need MORE MORE MORE of this.

I think they really need to know who Christine Eugene is. Oklahoma got it right, when they said her violence is escalating. Keep her for the full 4 years..no early release\u203c\ufe0f\n\u56de\u590d @PicturesFoIder They set you up\u2026.caught you driving too closely, and decided to catch a quick payday. You were indeed driving too closely\u2026allowing for zero reaction time.\n\u56de\u590d @yeaokkkkkkkkk @toothlesscryBAB What Jaidyn doesn\u2019t realize is..so many doors would start opening up for her when she completely dumps BumpFace, and stop living her life under his rule. She\u2019s pretty, intelligent, and very well spoken. She could get into acting and singing\u2026real music, not that BF bullcrap.\n\u56de\u590d @libsoftiktok Track them all down\u2026using that high tech facial recognition, alien technology that the government keeps sayin doesn\u2019t exist\u2026.find them..and get them out of this country permanently.\n\u56de\u590d @SwallowedUup @Coreylombardii I think Junior may have a visible injury, which would make her choose to keep him off camera. Think about it\u2026jr has become her meal ticket. She uses him to garner support from her fans. So to suddenly not show him is very telling. She doesn\u2019t care how badly people talk about his\n\u56de\u590d @gina63810302 @chriseanupdates Exactly. By them suddenly saying he\u2019s being seen by a doctor, only proves they knew ALL ALONG that he hadn\u2019t been to a doctor.  See, they never cared about Jr, or they would\u2019ve been on her neck a long time ago for neglecting his health, rather than encouraging her bad behavior.\n\u56de\u590d @CancelChrisean All she needs is a bone in her nose. Geeez! She\u2019s like a dude who woke up one morning with tits. Like, she\u2019s not even supposed to have them. I can\u2019t even explain it.\n\u56de\u590d @JaniceB47157220 @Coreylombardii That\u2019s how we know her brain ain\u2019t brainin. She\u2019s a short busser..a paint chip muncher..a crop dust sniffer..her elevator is stuck on the 1st floor..and her favorite flavor is the #4. She and Jr will be in the same grade. Jr  has ZERO chance of a good upbringing with this \ud83e\udd21\n\u56de\u590d @chayil_lewis @FREEL0LA And the nurse KNEW all along CrotchRot was lying. This is why I keep sayin nurses have to start reporting incidents like this. They\u2019re in the life saving field\u2026but turning a blind eye to obvious signs of neglect. Whatever happened to \u201cif you see something..say something!\u201d\n\u56de\u590d @amberlockhert Wow\u2026when you sell your soul for fame and money, you\u2019ll do literally anything. Look at that clown..wanted fame so bad she was willing to throw her entire race under the bus. And the fact that she does it with so much enjoyment and vigor..with zero self awareness\u2026\u2026SHE\u2019S GONE\n\u56de\u590d @SSgirlJ9 @Coreylombardii Lmbo\u2026Thing2WHO from Whoville.

I'm all for homemaking, but this is not the 70s. It's harder than ever to support a family as inflation goes up. Men are mentally working themselves into depression trying to provide alone.\n\u56de\u590d @RadfemBlack Any statistics from pornhub should always be taken with a grain of salt. They lie a lot and have too many lawsuits to be taken seriously. Pleasure and pain can exist in safe and consensual settings. Sex and violence can not. The two are not the same. Pornhub is sexual violence\n\u56de\u590d @fujostarion Especially when it comes to male gaze vs. female gaze and consent. Porn desensitizes men and young boys to believe that what girls/women \"want\" or \"respect\"/respond to the best is violence/coercion. And pushes inc*st, cp, etc. They also ignore any acknowledgment toward consent.\n\u56de\u590d @PaulyToad25 Thank you. I've been saving it for the perfect conversation.

They rely on children being innocent/naive/impressionable/gullible to fulfill their sick fantasy\ud83e\udd22 They know exactly how to choose their victims. When kids are actually educated on it, they are more likely to speak up.\n\u56de\u590d @_nomadic_soul Men don't want to understand. They believe that women are just being emotional, and this is just based off of feeling but men have shown over and over why they should by responding violently. Wouldn't you say that's emotional?\n\u56de\u590d @robkhenderson Yeah I can tell this article didn't talk to actual women. Women  are not into that stuff the way that men think they are. Most women do not like WATCHING porn because the pleasure is rarely about the women. Most women like erotic audios. Quinn for example has gotten popular...\n\u56de\u590d @StackingWs @pearlythingz As a women I agree with everything you said. One of the few sane people out there. I wish there was more ADULT conversation about this than just arguing and blaming each other\n\u56de\u590d @isabellayonce A lot of women and men don't report it for that reason. They don't feel like it qualify as being called rape. It's even more confusing when a child goes through it since they don't understand what's happening to their bodies and why it's reacting in that way.\n\u56de\u590d @_celia_bedelia_ Studies show that it literally takes on average 7 attempt to permanently get away from an abuser\n\u56de\u590d @Thaleresq @jakeshieldsajj I've been reading up on it lately and there is a pretty big reason he did, what he did.

Children are struggling and need proper sex Ed not porn. They need to learn consent from an early age, and they need limited access to internet\n\u56de\u590d @revelfemme Before feminism young boys didn't have many laws protecting them. They made it possible for there to be an age of consent for boys against adult men because there wasn't really any until the 90s do to the HIV/AIDs epidemic. Men also didn't want their son to be gay.\n\u56de\u590d @joeymama2121 @ubelfem True but even though they are barely legal...why do you think they have girls that already look underage infantilize themselves even farther.

Plus in the video you can see a black girl try to defend her but someone else jumped in started fighting that girl.\n\u56de\u590d @robkhenderson Women love BDSM but not in the way that porn shows it. BDSM is NOTHING like porn shows. That's the problem. Women don't like violence they like giving partial/total control in a comfortable and safe setting, not violence. Even fifty shades is a shitty depiction of that.\n\u56de\u590d @wheresurhusband @Cluffalo Yeah, that's also lacking social skills. That actually does more harm than good. If sex is the first thing to come to mind when you think of \"intimacy\" and social skills that's not good. Making out with drunk girls is to you can practice social skills sounds predatory\n\u56de\u590d @_nomadic_soul The question wasn't \"Would you rather be raped and murdered by a bear or a man?\" The question was,\"Would you rather be alone or come across a man or a bear in the woods.\" Men made up all the murder/rape scenarios and memes. That's why women chose the bear. You gave them examples\n\u56de\u590d @DoomScroling It's worst than what you think\n\u56de\u590d @HarrietCarried One 10 year old was raped by her deacon at 9. Her mom forced her to get married to the man who raped her who was in his 20s. She had 5/6 kids by the time she was 16 years old. One of the saddest stories I've heard.  Victims aren't old enough to divorce, so they're trapped  til 18\n\u56de\u590d @AZVotes Laws to protect boys from men are still pretty new.   It wasn't until the 60s feminist movement that they requested laws also protecting boys under 18 from being abused/sexual exploited. Conservative christians fought to keep it 16 (and still do).  They don't want to protect boys\n\u56de\u590d @FearedBuck Isn't that called Tantric sex. It's supposed to ground and connect the mind, body, and soul while releasing built-up sexual energy. It's supposed to be really useful for men, too, and could help them reach multiple orgasms\n\u56de\u590d @PaulyToad25 It's honestly just the start of grooming. That's how they \"test the waters\" to see if the child's the perfect victims.  The more the victims tolerate and try to brush it off as nothing, the harder they push and the worse it gets, especially if they think they won't get caught.\n\u56de\u590d @joeymama2121 @ubelfem The whole reason the teen category got taken down was because they were getting caught up. They've verified several videos of underage girls. They cater to violence. If they had nothing to hide why did they delete 80% of their content.\n\u56de\u590d @j0rdan0fjupit3r @denimneverdies It's from the website Exodus Cry. Trigger warning, though.
