You are falling for the oldest trick in the book.

You dummy!\n\u56de\u590d @javariatareen You are using your platform to spread misinformation and fuel and fuel further vitriol.

At least they won\u2019t be shooting to premises and innocent people\n\u56de\u590d @PriscillaPoind3 You posted this 3 times before you got the attention you craved. That\u2019s pretty sad behaviour not to mention a word salad of crap. Go ask for help now before you deteriorate further.\n\u56de\u590d @WillAdamslsd @ClaireK14001817 @em_lou_G @TRobinsonNewEra Funnily enough the UK adolescents were taught how to behave.

This is a wider issue regarding the fact we have no right to anyone\u2019s medical information if they are sick.
