This is what gives it meaning &amp; power. Look at the Lord's Prayer in Mtt 6: 9-13. If we get it right from there &amp; nourish it like the Jews &amp;many Christians, your Prayer is will be effective.\nThe greatest gift of spirituality is awareness, seeing things as they are, both evil &amp; good. We're creatures of love &amp; loved into existence by God our Father through Jesus our Brother &amp;GodWithUs. We can't love until we're loved! 1 Jn 4: 19. A call to humility in a loveless world!\nSimply follow @simon_ekpa  &amp; see it in the first or 2nd post.\nMay I also introduce you to my Spiritual Boyfriend, Saint Aloysius Gonzaga, who incidentally was of a Jesuit Order. I have many things in common with him: a prince with a pure, religious &amp; caring heart! So we have Virgin Mary as our Spiritual Mother &amp; Jesus our Brother &amp; God.\nJesus, whose image I bear from conception for eternity can never harm me any time, anywhere, anyhow. He tells me in Mtt 11: 28-30 to come to Him to find rest, to learn from Him bc He's gentle &amp; humble of heart.' To be humble is to be truthful. Muhammed is not humble but a liar!\nJesus asked the Jews listening to His new teaching in John 10: 32-33 why they were trying to stone Him &amp; they said: 'We are not stoning you for a good work but for blasphemy. You, a man, are making yourself God!' Same thing Saul did zealously but in ignorance b4 becoming Paul.\n5yrs later, I saw that man looking very wretched,the spirit has left him! Some day, I heard someone hailing from a distance 'Man of God!' I look toward the direction, &amp; behold, it was him. I was buying Garden Eggs.  Many young men &amp; girls are spiritually tormented. Learn from me.\nNow JESUS is our Way, Truth &amp; Life &amp; the fruit of His life on earth consistently reveals Him as such. There's no lie in Him, He raises the death, &amp; through Him we experience God as our loving Dad. Islam clearly is anti-Christ, anti-truth, anti-life, anti-God's way of life: LOVE!\nLord Jesus Christ, if there's any way, any reason, any unmerited favor you could use to save UK from being Islamized for the general good, please do it for us. You are the rightful owner of our body, soul &amp; spirit, &amp; we worship in all things your holy Will in our regard. Amen.\nBut whoever is joined to the Lord (Jesus) becomes one spirit with Him. Avoid immortality. Every other sin a person commits is outside the body, but the immoral person sins against his own body. Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, ...?\nFulani, Hamas, Islam, Lucifer &amp; anybody or nation that supports Islamization of Judeo-Christian Biafrans are joined to the case against UK b4 Father God. As a co-heir with Christ in His kingdom, I'm a respected Senior Advocate of Biafra. We have the Mind of Christ. - 1 Cor 2: 16\nIslam is a false religion. Can this old man sleep with two young girl &amp; satisfy them sexually? My guess is that he'll faint &amp; die! Talk less of 72 Virgins! No heavenly reward for Alisha! In Mtt. 22: 30, Jesus says that there's no marriage in heaven. Everyone will be like Angels.\nLadies &amp; Gentlemen, notice how UK is secretly &amp; overtly behind every division, conflict &amp; war in the world, \ud83d\udcb6 Europe, Ukraine, Africa, Israel, Biafra, Ambazonia, Congo &amp; Islamic Arab Nations. They support them obviously &amp; waste human blood carelessly &amp; unjustly for UK-Interest!\nSo when I notice that I'm spiritually, mentally or intellectually more developed, then I'll deliberately start to attend social functions to improve &amp; integrate on those areas gradually, I'll seek help on my emotional expressions &amp; balancing. Only Jesus is well developed in all!\nLove is 'clarity of perception &amp; accuracy of response', according to an Indian Jesuit priest &amp; my Spiritual Director, eternally living in me, Fr Anthony de Mello, SJ., a mystical man that is truly free, fully human &amp; divine like Jesus. Salwan Momika has true love for humanity!\nSalwan Momika, Imtiaz Mahmood &amp; myself are jolly good fellows who love Humanity at Peace without ISLAM. What about you being human? How on earth can you sensibly regard a murderer, child- rapist, ingrate, deluded,  sadist, invader, slavemaster like Muhammed as a Prophet of God?\nPosition &amp; Person, which one is more important? For the worldly &amp; Islam, it's the Position for power, control, intimidation, manipulation, enslavement, sexual gratification, hatred &amp; slaughter, but for Lord Jesus it's the Person to be loved, nurtured, dignified &amp; freed in truth.\nLovely. Thanks a lot.\nThe truth is now coming out gradually.\nSad but I put my trust in Jesus Christ, GodWithUs, bc the battle is entirely His to win with us &amp; for us. I put my trust gratefully too in my PM, Spokesman, Gen Simon Ekpa, in BLA, BDF &amp; our helpers best known to Simon. The reality is that FG,UK,US &amp;France are under Trial b4 God!\nThis is why I may not pity UK for what has befallen her already with Islam that will soon be manifested. I am a spiritual man &amp; I can tell you, the Spirit of Jesus has left UK as she's left the principles of God. UK has fallen along with Fulani! She thinks she's smart to be evil!\nLord Jesus, when I asked you to spare UK from total annihilation by Islam, it was on a premise that she has humbly repented of her criminal sins against Biafrans, Africans, Humanity &amp;Yourself. But if in her Pride, she refuses to repent now, give UK exactly what she wishes for us.\nI didn't share my prayer with anybody for correction, yet on the surface I looked calm, expecting to die! But instead of Jesus taking advantage of me, He showed me exceptional grace, understanding &amp; mercy. It was the time I started having extraordinary experience of Virgin Mary.\nI had an extraordinary experience at night in 2015 in my room. I saw Virgin Mary gorgeously dressed with a multitude of people. My room turned to a big hall filled with her entourage! I was jumping up in joy, &amp; she spoke: 'I am the Mother of God!' A Dr was threatening me then!\nUSA is not about Biden, Kamala, Obama, Michelle, &amp; opening USA borders to flood in Islamic Arab Terrorist Nations supported by Iran to upset the Vote to impose Terrorism &amp;Demon-crats. USA is all about American citizens, their progress &amp; well-being that President Trump stands for.\nLet us make man in our image, and after our likeness. Let them (not him alone) have dominion over the fish of the sea, (not mermaids), the birds of the air, &amp; the cattle, &amp; over all the wild animals &amp; all the creatures that crawl on the ground,(including the envious Serpent!\"\nI Love Trump! No Apology!\nHuman life is indestructible bc we resemble God in our Soul &amp; Spirit despite the fragility of the Body. 'But we hold this treasure (Christ) in pots of earthenware,so that the immensity of the power is God's, not our own.' -2 Cor.4: 7. And even the body will resurrect after death!\n'They are well aware of God's ordinance: that those who behave like this deserve to die - yet they only do it, but even applaud others who do the same.'  See how Islamic practices are well captured &amp; condemned in this passage.  Those that uphold Islam are enemies of GodWithUs!\nI just trust &amp; plead that the illegal migrants WON'T BE ALLOWED TO VOTE AGAINST TRUMP, TO VOTE AT ALL.

Now, they know Marlago is a mortgaged to the hilt hotel.\n\u56de\u590d @mmpadellan @BEVHOWARD40 You're absolutely right. trump mocks anyone with a disability he even mocks mocks captured military and Maga's cheer him on for it.

I want to be like Ted. \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 https://t.co/fGUbhGkdLY\n\u56de\u590d @MarioNawfal Yes, I am thinking leaving Queens in 2018 was the right decision.  Twenty years was enough, but I never had to deal with that level of crazy.\n\u56de\u590d @EliAfriatISR I support Israel because I detest bullies...Israel is a beacon of hope surrounded by savages who want to destroy it.  My wife and I have worked, lived, celebrated and grieved with our Jewish friends over thirty years.....to us, supporting Israel is supporting our friends. \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf1\ud83d\udc4d\n\u56de\u590d @VividProwess https://t.co/AHUqS6wtpq\n\u56de\u590d @RogerJStoneJr Red Snapper Roger.........\ud83d\ude0b\n\u56de\u590d @itsalexkay Thank the stars for being a male, and doubly glad she is a woman.\n\u56de\u590d @AngelTheHighest I worked in Cordova Alaska in the fish factories, and lived in a tent during the summer of 1991......we got ahold of some Matanuska Thunder F$#@ (MTF) and we almost got lost in the forest it was so strong....a creeper strain that hit HARD.  Look up Organic Remedies!  Cheers\n\u56de\u590d @ScottPresler Thank you all...excellent work!!\n\u56de\u590d @daatdarling Yes, they are hard, but easily approachable with at least two Old Fashions for liquid courage........wait, what are we talking about?\n\u56de\u590d @rickyricksmusic Diner's Club ultimate member.\n\u56de\u590d @leslibless That was mathematically impossible, and they certified it.  Fetterman was the Lt. Gov that certified that election, which was questionable in that amount of votes being entered in the last hours.  We need to match ballots with actual IDs of US Citizen only.\n\u56de\u590d @CGasparino Nope.  Agree with Charles 100%.  He just crapped himself in front of the world.  There is no best case scenario.  We look like clown shoes......weak and feckless.\n\u56de\u590d @SteveLovesAmmo Twinkle Time Tim Tiptoeing Through The Tulips\n\u56de\u590d @FitGirlMJ That is incredible!!  I am just getting used to 20lb as my base weight.......tried a 35 recently and that was hard..you doing 50s is my new goal!  Nice work.\n\u56de\u590d @sentdefender All people that support Israel, Jewish and Non-Jewish alike, must reconsider their political support in the US to only back politicians who will not play games with these level of stakes.  Remember, there are many supporters here who disagree with the current administration.\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf1\n\u56de\u590d @DateLindsay Chained Heat!\n\u56de\u590d @321gaux I got up at 6:45 AM, and weeded the garden, and then carried 8 eight 50 lb bags of red barkdust and two 40 lbs bags of crushed marble to finish landscaping.  Not nearly as cool as working on a vineyard mind you, but starting the day active nonetheless.\n\u56de\u590d @lippyent Mickey Rourke, one of our finest actors.\n\u56de\u590d @NiohBerg We must all hang together and support each other with their respective struggles.  The forces of darkness are allied against Ukraine, Czech Republic, Taiwan, Argentina, Israel and the US.  Together, we are stronger.\n\u56de\u590d @atensnut While I do trade and understand how the higher tax rate on capital gains will harm this country, I highly doubt that a primary house would be subject to that tax treatment.  Plus, that would apply (yes, I know at the start) to $100M+ people....so I think this is fear porn.\n\u56de\u590d @JoeyMannarinoUS I agree the tax rate is high Joey; I do think that LLCs. Corp S offer legitimate tax deductions (17 are major) as part of the solution has got to be more people organizing as businesses to be independent contractors that can be paid on a 1099 basis and gain those legal deductions\n\u56de\u590d @VividProwess May she recover quickly.  Unacceptable.  Police need to move in and start cracking heads.\n\u56de\u590d @NASA @Space_Station @NASA_Astronauts @BoeingSpace @ulalaunch May the journey be a safe one.  USA Strong !\n\u56de\u590d @cutigs1 Yes, this is definitely some kryptonite for the senses....gorgeous!\n\u56de\u590d @CaryKelly11 We are trying to wean ourselves onto better salad dressings, as we like diced sweet peppers with a salad with our protein.  Sugar has become our mortal enemy.  Talenti Gelato is especially evil, specifically Coffee Chocolate Chip.\n\u56de\u590d @DaveMcCormickPA Good point Dave!  When I can't sleep, I used to look at a picture of Bob Casey talking without sound and its like literal Ambien....out in five minutes.  Because I now know how awful he is as a Senator, that trick no longer works.  I voted last time for you....I will vote again.\n\u56de\u590d @ScottPresler @elonmusk Scott....consider a decent Trane air conditioning unit.  We have heat oil, and an electric water heater....no gas though...just did not want to be that outlier whose house exploded because of a leak.  No issues with heat oil.  Congratulations on your house...we are in York, PA.\n\u56de\u590d @johncusack Nice attempt John; respectfully, I would disagree your assertion.  Inflationary pressures due to a suspension in the Petrodollar agreement with Saudi Arabia is a concerning element, as is the neo centric BRIC push to have a separate (US immune) financial system backed by Gold/Oil", "overlap_score": 0.1201018917569243, "MARITAL": "Married", "AREA": "Suburbs", "INCOME": "Middle Income", "RACE": "White Alone", "EMPLOYMENT": "Working now", "RELIGIOUS": "No religion", "PARTY": "Republican Party", "AGE": "Elderly (over 65 years old)", "IDEOLOGY": "Liberal", "GENDER": "Male"}]
