People wanna be somewhere else.\n\u56de\u590d @HortonHearsTx @DanPatrick Rachel, curious to get your thoughts.  Does it not concern you that Jace is running a proxy campaign via Toni Ortiz (Current Revolt)?  Keep in mind, Toni is actively attacking Abraham George as well.  Doesn't that demonstrate poor judgement from Jace?  https://t.co/8BRJ4qqGeV\n\u56de\u590d @bradj_TX @DadePhelan When Phelan loses, it'll be decisions like this that should be highlighted.  You could run your entire campaign for $214k, and it's being pissed away on pointless cable TV buys.  Literally costing him $1k per vote earned.\n\u56de\u590d @NateSchatzline Nate, voting out an incumbent is not that simple. Not all 10 - 15 would lose.  Is it possible to withhold support for legislation in order to garner support for an alternative Speaker to Phelan?

Look closely. We were founded as a Christian  nation. I know the religiophobic lose their minds over this, but it isn\u2019t debatable. The bill of rights has nothing to do with being founded as a Christian nation.\n\u56de\u590d @krassenstein @philthatremains Nope. You don\u2019t get to tell people to fuck off today. He\u2019s right. You contributed to this. While I applaud you recognizing this is bad and shouldn\u2019t be done. This is the part where you have some self reflection. And just go silent for a week. Or maybe two.\n\u56de\u590d @thehill Fair is a very relative word. That doesn\u2019t really begin to be sufficient in a legal situation like this one.\n\u56de\u590d @WashTimes Historically whenever you have far left wing tendencies, like most college campuses, it inevitably leads to reduction of personal liberty.\n\u56de\u590d @TonyaMe82093191 @SpeakerPelosi Accountability is a door that swings both ways. It may yet smack a donkey\n\u56de\u590d @cmc4diversity @RedHibiscus23 @BlackKnight10k Well he literally almost died. So you think the left wing loonies could cut him a little slack. But no\u2026..nope they can\u2019t\n\u56de\u590d @CobyBethea @OverXposed1 @aliasvaughn The shooter looked pretty good guyed to me. Secondly, stop trying to use the gun debate as smoke screen to cover up what the real conversation is. Left wing extremism\n\u56de\u590d @7Veritas4 Blue at any price huh? This isn\u2019t a double standards discussion. This is a you are denying what we all seen. And we were lied to. And somehow you\u2019re making excuses for it.\n\u56de\u590d @NBCNews No one cares. Nor should they.\n\u56de\u590d @timwilliamsart @Michell33650674 I can see someone is pushing another: \u201cI want this to be true\u201d narrative.\n\u56de\u590d @JoJoFromJerz It\u2019s entirely political. After all, your cult proceeded to impeach Trump twice with little to no evidence. Then continued to use that impeachment platform to promote false Russian collusion charges. But let\u2019s not get into how they tried to overturn the 2016 election.\n\u56de\u590d @brianstelter They already are planning on attacking the SCOTUS by packing it. They have talked about abolishing the senate due to \u201cequity\u201d. Let\u2019s not forget a ministry of truth attempt. If they win again, they will use the victory as a perceived mandate.\n\u56de\u590d @JoeBiden We will see.\n\u56de\u590d @DavesTWAccount @YesCornwall That\u2019s because those areas were not Ethnically distinctive. The Cornish are a distinct people. Also, they haven\u2019t been a nation due to Anglo-Saxon interference and domination.\n\u56de\u590d @PalmBchCitizen You mean the same cages that were being used by the previous administrations? That\u2019s jack wagons like you didn\u2019t care about until a Repub. was in office? Or that the current administration refuses to enforce the border hardly at all? By all means keep calling others fascists\u2026\u2026.\n\u56de\u590d @davidhogg111 So because a few bad people did really bad things. And others made mistakes in security protections. We should just completely surrender individual liberty. Surrender the right to self defense and self preservation. Because you have a phobia?\n\u56de\u590d @Ms_MMMJ No\u2026\u2026project 2025 was the distraction from the discord within the DNC over Biden\n\u56de\u590d @mrbenwexler That\u2019s because most of the 44, (the notable exception of Lincoln) didn\u2019t have to deal with fanatic cultists running the DNC. Screaming how democracy will die if you don\u2019t vote for them. While simultaneously, claiming they have to destroy democracy to save it\n****UPDATE**** For the second day in a row, @KeithOlbermann  threatens violence and insurrection by calling for the SCOTUS to be dissolved. Over 400 Democrats liked his post. After his initial call for dissolving of the court, Olbermann has been mocked by many.\n\u56de\u590d @SenSchumer @POTUS So can your opposition now also make the claim that you\u2019re packing the court?\n\u56de\u590d @acnewsitics This is the most art in jeopardy where the contestant says: \u201cBullshit that Alex Cole says\u201d\n\u56de\u590d @Jasonfest @unbalancedChaos I don\u2019t think you would know the genocide of a termite colony let alone any actual genocide of human beings.\n\u56de\u590d @HuffmanForNC Do you have any idea how many registered Republicans I know, that have never voted for a republican in their life.\n\u56de\u590d @JoJoFromJerz Yeah\u2026.how dare the court interpret the constitution!\n\u56de\u590d @TeaPainUSA So how long before you metaphorically knife all of independents and republicans?\n\u56de\u590d @CrispyShroom @FATFabandthick @vancemurphy @robreiner Impeachment is a political process. Not a legal one. And the next time you accuse others of being in a cult, you probably shouldn\u2019t be in a cult. Stop spreading fear and disinformation. It\u2019s because of people like you that we get assassins.\n\u56de\u590d @TheRickyDavila Sue the leader and organizer of the protest with slander\n\u56de\u590d @thehill Of course. That\u2019s because there is no such thing as gender affirming care. In fact, when you actually examine that phrase you begin to understand how it\u2019s completely illogical. words made up left wing extremists attempting to sabotage language in order to create justification.\n\u56de\u590d @JoJoFromJerz One has nothing to do with the other. Whatever Trump did or didn\u2019t do, give zero excuse for the fact she isn\u2019t standing up for her policies. If you want the nuclear codes, show the people who you are. Answer tough questions. Stop hiding.\n\u56de\u590d @thehill It\u2019s funny to me how people will consistently try to sell you on everything the right and republicans are doing to destroy democracy.
