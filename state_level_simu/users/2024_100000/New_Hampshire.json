Many men do not find provocative and/or revealing sexy. It\u2019s try-hard, cheap, easy and appeals to the most base of instincts and reactions. Similarly, it is why even the most \u201chigh end\u201d of strip clubs are the opposite of sexy.\n\u56de\u590d @mechanical_monk @Aella_Girl 2 all day. This is a widely shared view.   Women can ignore and continue to dress according to \u201cwhat makes me feel pretty\u201d. That\u2019s fine! It\u2019s also how most men dress.  Just don\u2019t come back asking why guys don\u2019t give two shits about your overly chic get up with clanky ass shoes.\n\u56de\u590d @AJManaseer Anyone compiling the socialist grifting cunts having a tough time tonight/tomorrow/forever \u2014 tag me please. Thanks.\n\u56de\u590d @SHistorians @TheIowaHawkeyes @IowaWBB The main issue is you all keep talking nonstop about it, and almost in a way that feels like you need the rest of us to care more.  A lot of us just don\u2019t care and don\u2019t find it that impressive. For me, it\u2019s roughly the equivalent of a someone breaking a junior high boys record.\n\u56de\u590d @aimeeterese It wasn\u2019t so long ago \u2014 and yet it was \u2014 that the most popular show on TV had Denise Richards portray a 15 year old with cleavage that could not be ignored, to the point of being caught by her father / their boss. We all understood it, laughed, and moved on. https://t.co/QHeq6f5crH\n\u56de\u590d @seattle_tax - Fit/attractive: you imputed this to him, and isn\u2019t exclusive to men  - business/assets: marriage itself would entitle a spouse to much of that, and in divorce  - social/emot\u2019l needs: think you forgot you were doing gender swap  - jokes: men don\u2019t really talk about their wives\n\u56de\u590d @Trust_Lion_ Dude, if you can\u2019t get over the fact she rejected you at some other point, *fine*. Tell her you hope she\u2019s well but don\u2019t think it makes sense to meet up.   But it seems like you\u2019re 100% interested and want everyone to validate your moody, bitchy, teen behavior.\n\u56de\u590d @bhargreaves Imagine coming in with this level of derision for the completely understandable reaction of 99.99% of people, and then your take is\u2026  Fix housing court.   One step away from needing to understand the Root Causes of Squatting.  Jesus Christ.\n\u56de\u590d @den_draft @shanebacon @golfgirlrobin Because golf is one the sports where, through different tees, you can artificially neuter the skill and strength advantage of men.   And then pretend like it\u2019s a true test of who is best for rent seekers like Shane and simps now infecting other sports besides college basketball.\n\u56de\u590d @r1_gordo @LeadershipAcad1 And the uniformity across restaurants. I could go get a burger at 20 places and know that 95% will fall between 15-20. And that implicitly reflects typical restaurant margins, their ability to operate successfully, etc.\n\u56de\u590d @j_shuskey1 \u201cHe only runs a logistics firm and belongs to a TN Ross?\u201d  \u201cThen no, it\u2019s actually very good again that my wife works a soul draining job that she resents deep down\u201d  \u201cNo, these members will in fact be impressed with my merch  spree headcovers\u201d\n\u56de\u590d @thechosenberg Nope. Ex can share the reason if it\u2019s so important, and then decide if in-person meeting necessary. Until then, not even a consideration.   Wife is 100% in the right. Easy call too.\n\u56de\u590d @brucekenerson1 I wonder if everyone would be breathlessly sharing this picture of Marshall wasn\u2019t flailing her arms, head, and upper body (because the contact didn\u2019t come anywhere close to causing that).\n\u56de\u590d @ANGC_burner So we lose Snob and get more of this.  Have to admit we are getting cooked hard right now.\n\u56de\u590d @ChicagosMayor You know how there\u2019s imposter syndrome where you feel angst and doubt your abilities when you\u2019ve achieved external success?  You don\u2019t have that. Every panic attack you have is warranted.\n\u56de\u590d @NateAFischer @amasad He has been bitter for awhile about the supposed decrease in reach under Elon. But his writing and general engagement are almost purposefully limited to a narrow academic type. And he is then bemused when it doesn\u2019t get any broader traction.\n\u56de\u590d @Stealx @GoetzItSold The response of someone whose priority is keeping on the good side of politicians for biz reasons.   Fair, but perhaps just say nothing instead of banalities.\n\u56de\u590d @InezFeltscher @conservmillen have any of you ever just thought to shut the fuck up about this? A ton of us got dragged through it unwillingly due to no fault divorce. We know it\u2019s absolute shit. We grieve and worry every day for our kids.\n\u56de\u590d @BritMartinez No. It\u2019s a slutty dress in a summer print. Way too much cleavage, and length is too short.   This is if you want to appeal to men\u2019s base instincts. Fine. But the right woman in a true sundress captures the mind in an entirely different way.\n\u56de\u590d @NewRightPoast I will say that those expressions have a certain modern *female* characteristic that transcends political affiliation\n\u56de\u590d @Eli_B_Again @bigB_EOD @wanyeburkett @jds02006 Oh my gosh. Yes, if you are a sick fuck that needs to draw the throughline all the way out, it implicates sex. Or you can just take it for what it was, which was a slightly crass nod to a father\u2019s age-old aversion to boys courting their daughter. Again, look in the mirror.\n\u56de\u590d @EileenCookCnty Hey guys, Chicago is a cancerous hellhole due to criminal loving politicians, and the leading qualification for Cnty is she took on the Church.  Honestly will vote for another criminal lover over you. At least know what I\u2019m getting with them.\n\u56de\u590d @JaymalGreen If a white guy did what Dexter Reed did, we wouldn\u2019t give a fuck.  That\u2019s the difference between us and you. You have a soft spot for the shitstain culture and victim complex you grew up in, however much you try to portray yourself as free from it.\n\u56de\u590d @GoingDutchDEN @A_Glass_Man lol as if the word sidewalk was invented through Denver municipal code to denote that only walking can be done on it.   It is legal to ride your bike on the sidewalk there. You and your daughter are poor cyclists and the problem.   Imagine being a bad cyclist and a complete c***.\n\u56de\u590d @ppargolfer Lol I see we\u2019ve moved away from Caitlin Clark simping back to lpga simping.  Taking nerves out of it, I think a true scratch misses cut 95%+ of time but would absolutely not be DFL every time. Just a ridiculous statement.\n\u56de\u590d @den_draft @shanebacon @golfgirlrobin Take it to the extreme in golf. Imagine the tournament was a series of 4 footers. Anyone could and would win. It\u2019s why birdie fest / putting contest setups are lame. It\u2019s also why people love US Opens and brutally hard courses \u2014 to see who is truly the best. No chance here.\n\u56de\u590d @nrarmour They would both get smoked by an U-13 boys team, so it\u2019s not talent causing people to tune in. It\u2019s basically a freak show type fascination where a single woman is talented (comparatively) + a lot of men who like white knighting and then won\u2019t watch another game for years.\n\u56de\u590d @kclairerogers Hey guys the 4 who pretends to be a golf journalist by being their fwiend has political thoughts too, let\u2019s all gather round and listen closely\nBrandon Johnson is so bad at his job that, despite being black and pro-crime in a city where mostly black and pro-crime people vote, he\u2019s still going down in flames within the first year  Get fucked you 85 IQ \ud83e\udd21\n\u56de\u590d @DegenCPA22 In high school we marveled at this \u2014 at every level of attractiveness \u2014 and would simply say \u201clike dissolves like\u201d.

But I think firmly setting expectations for ourselves can help negate these outward expectations. #sayftychat\n\u56de\u590d @mwas_2 Love this one.

Welcome to #sayftychat Deepakshi. Acceptance &amp; not denial is the first step in addressing Mental Health challenges #sayftychat\n\u56de\u590d @declaireit Such a beautiful way to define it in a way. I think the culture of being human, in essence, is universal, which makes some parts of life apply to all of us. #SayftyChat\nA2. For starters, smaller ones include regularly following a healthy diet, exercise, and hydrate. Health is a top expectation for me.  Then professionally, I think keep exploring and reaching out. While, overwhelming, I set smaller goals to attain big end results.  #sayftychat\nA4. I think most of us have resilience in-built. It is how we apply it when we require it that differs.   While we choose some situations, some are out of our hands. Finding some courage to move on, and count on the blessings and beauty in life helps.   #sayftychat\n\u56de\u590d @kapoors_s Absolutely. It also depends on how deeply penetrated it is within our belief system. Studies have shown many women still hold their cultural beliefs to be true over other possibilities presented to them when it comes to work, how a house is run, childcare etc. #SayftyChat\n\u56de\u590d @kapoors_s @RachelintheOC When we shut them out by assuming they don't know anything, our \"adultism\" can squash the relationship really fast. #sayftychat\nWe have a few house rules:     1\ufe0f\u20e3 Say Hi!     2\ufe0f\u20e3 Answer Q\u2019s with A1, A2, A3, etc., so we can track the convo     3\ufe0f\u20e3 Use the #sayftychat hashtag so everyone sees the posts.     4\ufe0f\u20e3 Engage, be respectful!

For the death which started the prosecution an autopsy was performed and digoxin poisoning was \u201cestablished\u201d by an expert (this expert was chosen by the defense), one other death was also attributed to an overdose.\n\u56de\u590d @Overlordmainst1 @LucyLetbyTrials It is remarkable that the length of the investigation and trial is used as an argument for guilt but it works. The appeal verdict in the case of Lucia de Berk was one of the longest and most detailed ever delivered. This persuaded many Dutch people that she simply must be guilty.\n\u56de\u590d @AviSipsTea @Claireyalli But this particular baby was born with pneumonia and was not treated and was blue at birth. In what way was that stable? To first put the cause of her death as pneumonia and to later say she died with pneumonia not of pneumonia is very questionable.\n\u56de\u590d @sarah_owl3 @ianjones446 @vince8569 No there is not. If there had been the prosecution would not have spent endless hours on what she said to who on WhatsApp, whether she knew what going commando was and what she wore when she was arrested, her boyfriend, her bedroom etc.\n\u56de\u590d @JackTindale @MartinConcagh But as you do not even seem to know that the insulin cases were not murders (both children survived) and that the test used was not fit to determine whether insulin was actually administered you do not seem to be a reliable source for this case.\n\u56de\u590d @DavidTBTaylor @Ninam41397 @ClarkeMicah @nejgraham Can you tell me the exact words that she used for conceding rather than accepting. I am struggling with this. Could be because I am not a native speaker, the exact words one uses for conceding and admitting might help.\n\u56de\u590d @NeilRos55889793 @Overlordmainst1 2) They did however charge her with attempted murder. During that case it was stated that: \u201cthe Crown does not allege Letby caused her death\u201d.

Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me;;;\" They want us needy and hating each other.\n\u56de\u590d @FLWillRegret22 @flaGolfer55 I totally agree!!  People made fun of Obama being a Community Organizer but we need them!  That's an important job!!  And - We need young people involved!!  If you have the heart and the stamina for it, then you go girl~!!!\n\u56de\u590d @ChrisDJackson Those two people in that photo could retire.  Go home and live a quiet life.\n\u56de\u590d @QuancyClayborne Oh I hear you.  I broke my ankle, was confined for months, finally got out, went into my local grocery store and couldn't find jack nothin'!!

He is treading on thin ice. https://t.co/FGfX5tIvkd\nHe had me at Clearly Historic \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\n\u56de\u590d @TheRichFromCali They keep saying that.  And then, they are still here!  They might like China, Russia, Hungary, North Korea, Sudan, Burma, Zimbabwe, Uzbekista, Saudi Arabia, Turkmenistan, just head out.  And don't write. https://t.co/d00nlXmWTp\n\u56de\u590d @1948LibDemDoug @Mollyploofkins I cannot argue your point.  But, I refuse to give up hope because then, what's left?\ud83d\ude09\n\u56de\u590d @AmyLynnStL Nothing that involves happiness.  Maybe a funeral home coordinator?  or Pet Sematary?\n\u56de\u590d @RBReich Thank you!!  Its' refreshing to hear the truth clearly spoken !!\n\u56de\u590d @highbrow_nobrow I am older than Jackson Browne and younger than Joe Biden.  And I have to ask any woman who would support this person to be in office -- Why?  Why do you support him?  Maybe I am missing something.\n\u56de\u590d @RpsAgainstTrump I never know if something is obvious and I am missing it with these asks.  But I see a fat guy in a big coat acting like he's the greatest when he's just another assh*le in the world.\n\u56de\u590d @LunaLuvgood2020 \ud83e\ude75\n\u56de\u590d @guelphgirlchris \ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31  Why anyone wants to shoot an animal for fun, I don't know.  I guess that recessive gene from our prehistoric ancestors is gone from me.  Or maybe I was a bird or a squirrel.  Or a bunny.  Oh maybe an otter!\nHe's not intimidated by her.\ud83d\ude02  He's a busy man,\ud83d\ude0e he ain't got time for that.  Get over it, Marge, you look like an attention wh---, 'uh,a person who behaves in a provocative, outrageous, or reprehensible manner in order to attract attention.\n\u56de\u590d @harryjsisson Puts me in the mind of some lies from a George Harrison song :  \"Wah-wah Wah-wah Wah-wah Wah-wah Wah-wah Wah-wah Wah-wah Wah-wah\"\n\u56de\u590d @FPWellman Red Flag Walking\n\u56de\u590d @AnnieForTruth His supporters are not interested in that stuff!! This: Rich People-making more $$$s, having POWER Poor People-Free to Hate that's their POWER Christian Nationalist-Free to Hate/control Women Other People - I really don't know why they want him\n\u56de\u590d @RonFilipkowski Ha!  I saw this coming!! \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 The man lives a reality TV life.  And he surrounds himself with a cast of players. While he takes his orders from the likes of fascist ideologies.  What a piece of work this guy is. #VoteBlue  #VoteBlueToStopACriminalDictator\n\u56de\u590d @DetoxPoncho I shared this and I hope more people read it!  It's like we are being sabotaged by the Media!  I know people have their opinions for the moment and opinions for the long run, but good grief! the spinning!! make your head fall off!!\n\u56de\u590d @rickygervais Oh yes she does love her blanket.  How sweet.\n\u56de\u590d @highbrow_nobrow @Acyn Translation:  I tell you what, if trump were president he would have given Putin what he wanted of Ukraine because trump is afraid of Putin There was order in the world cos trump wanted the money and power. He gets a lot of money from Russia\n\u56de\u590d @Paultx890 Myself, I would buy a lovely cage, make it nice and comfy inside, food, water and leave the door open.  When you guest gets comfy, close the door, move the cage to the porch or a nice safe shady spot where the squirrel can easily come and go for shelter.\n\u56de\u590d @XenaWarrior2024 Donate?  Library?  Your nieces and nephews might like to have some ancient material to explore.\n\u56de\u590d @janisonhiatus Oh gee, that's so like when you go to commit crimes, you really gotta think about stuff like that!! I guess trump just never thought about it.   Oh well, too late now\nTrump is selling the Presidency?  Are we surprised and shocked!?  Hell to the NO.  That his end game, sell everything in America off to the highest bidder!!!\n\u56de\u590d @gudjeon @LongTimeHistory Awesome!  Lucky daughter you have!! I have 2 sons and 1 darling daughter, their dad taught them all the same things about a car, household repairs, etc.  They were the ones who fixed the bikes for their friends growing up. My sons can cook and clean!\n\u56de\u590d @CalltoActivism Does anyone really think his VP pick makes the difference for win or lose?  Why would an Independent be swayed by Vance or any other pick for that matter.
