Nursing is consistently ranked as one of the most competitive programs to enter and one of the more difficult degrees to get. Not every woman in scrubs is a RN, a lot of CMA/NAs cosplay as nurses but they're not the same\nUnpopular opinion: this hate for nurses is rooted in misogyny &amp; jealousy.
