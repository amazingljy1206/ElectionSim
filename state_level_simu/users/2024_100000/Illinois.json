Those who overcome deceptions of the devil have different attitudes thereby grouping them in 12 tribes.  Question  How do you distribute 7 different gifts to 12 different tribes?\n\u56de\u590d In Rev 11, there is no mention of any church again because of failures.

In school, students write examination to prove their knowledge. In obeying the commandments of heaven, we face tests, trial, persecution and tribulation to prove faith in the Creator who is the Examiner.\nChristianity does not unify all the different churches. Churches tend to serve God of the Bible though Judas also belongs to church. Sorry, Church is not Christianity. If Christianity is church, no need for church. All churches are corrupt and Christianity is devil's religion.\nThere are many churches and they are antagonistic to one and the other.

I wonder why?\nOr, and hear me out, considerably less people do drugs in Kensington.  Sounds crazy. Especially to orgs whose salaries are paid through MILLIONS of syringes dealt out per year\nLess than 1/3 students. I'm so surprised!  I wonder if Penn will capitulate to the demands of these unaffiliated Leftist losers\n\u56de\u590d @andrealtrez @AndrewFiggy @PhillyMayor @PennDOTSec @fishtown @PPD26Dist IIRC someone from the camp was murdered on an adjoining neighborhood street  It's weird when people say theyre out of the way. Where do you think these highly volatile people go to steal wares for drugs? On our neighborhood streets. They also shoot up in our parks. Not acceptable\nYep, the guys camping out under I-95, throwing trash all over the place and doing the lean every time I pass by are definitely working a job  Ridiculous statement from @KendraPHL. If you don't deal with the facts of a problem, you have no hope of solving it\n\u56de\u590d @WillEvans215 Yes, but I am also skeptical of the conviction total bc we just don't know.\nDidn't Jamie directly contribute to the lack of affordable housing?  What's that saying about the firefighter and the arsonist?\nDoes anyone own or use a sled in Philly (outside of a gym)?  Where do you do it? If at a park or field, any problems? What's your system for transport of sled and weights? Any other tips? https://t.co/BNmrmDT3KX\nYes, and that's fine, because the addicts are not the primary concern here  It may sound crazy to some - not prioritizing the needs of antisocial parasites - but the goal is to help the regular people and actual residents of Kensington\nOne reason might be, and this may be surprising, the drug dealing gangs operating in Kensington protect their territory and trade with violence.  Good to see this community getting the attention it was promised - and has long deserved\n\u56de\u590d @FeatStinky Yes, because you don't *really* know that a gun toting drug dealer illegally carrying a firearm *actually* intends to use that gun to shoot someone until he shoots someone  We must always remain reactive\nAntisocial behavior drives all levels of crime.  The crime specificity myth was never believable\nYou can comb through all of my posts ever and you will find exactly zero where I profess my desire to murder anyone, let alone a group of people  Can't say the same for this leader of the Palestinian protests  And this homicidal video is from only 3 months ago\n\u56de\u590d @harrisonfinberg Agreed, the same depressive effect can even be seen on Market Street with the methadone clinic on 9th.  But also, hitting these astronomical numbers is not a marker of success - it's an obvious problem and contributing to the high concentration of dealers and addicts\nThe Philly streetery debate is really durable. I don't get it; seems like common sense:  If it's in the street it needs impact safety features  If it's on the sidewalk __ft must be available for pedestrians  Obvious requirements for appearance / structure. Let businesses business\n\u56de\u590d @LoriDEsq I look forward to his next murder in 10 years.\n\u56de\u590d @grilli262 What is allowed to happen at the airport - a major, regional hub of travel and commerce - is really unbelievable.  And it's not just bad for arrivals - the local suburban travelers going through PHL see it as a representation of Philadelphia. Dirty and disordered is a bad look\nThe benefit of incapacitation (prison) is for society, but often times also for the criminal.  Can't get shot 15 times in prison\nAny honest analysis of recent decarceration in Philadelphia can't ignore the correlation to homicides https://t.co/w9piwrl2Ik\n\u56de\u590d @fountaintheo27 I appreciate your story and the clarity with which you tell it  But Kensington can't wait for the personal epiphany of every addict on the street. That's the attitude that got it where it is: a regional Mecca of the drug trade at critical mass. And you're an example of that too\nUnlike the @PhillyInquirer, who promotes well connected activists in agreement with their progressive agenda, @TheFP (a national outlet), gave a voice to residents of Kensington  Unsurprisingly, they think the harm-reductionists are simply addict enablers https://t.co/BCUHvPuHEi https://t.co/wTWEgeXmeQ\n\u56de\u590d @fountaintheo27 There needs to be less tolerance of the disorder there, with much more enforcement. The supply side needs to be aggressively punished and deterred, with lengthy prison terms, but the demand side also needs to be meaningfully reduced - neither exists in a vacuum\nThe guy who ran down Market Street punching elderly people and women in the head has a long criminal history.  I'm stunned  This is what happens when the city abides SMI vagrants living on the streets\n\u56de\u590d @CaralhoPhilly yeah, there seems to be an easy way to address any real concern. and there will be some restaurants on a one lane street with a narrow sidewalk who can't have them  No reason to over regulate it.\n\u56de\u590d @fentasyl Decarceration is eclipsed only by openly allowing fentanyl use as the most deadly policy decision in Philadelphia https://t.co/VuVvXNmLbH\n\u56de\u590d @CaralhoPhilly @PhillyMayor I think the mayor can treat each activist group as she pleases. If she doesn't agree with their policies, this is fine  It's not just the endorsement, it's the open hostility by the people runnig that specific group.
