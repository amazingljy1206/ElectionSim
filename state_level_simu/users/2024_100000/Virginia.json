It's computationally cheaper to \"share patterns\" than to \"discover them independently\"\n\u56de\u590d @Scampleton @joelmartinez @iBrews It's like cramming 4+ (high res/high frame rate) displayport and a dozen USB signals in a single cable. It's just a logistical nightmare.  There is no consumer ready cable standard that can handle that kind of bandwidth.\n\u56de\u590d @_Octopus0 @UploadVR They added hand tracking (worked with Quest 1 too) to Vacation Simulator shortly after it launched. Cosmonious High never had hand tracking though.\n\u56de\u590d @Thrilluwu Are you familiar with Bret Victor? He has done several talks pointing out areas where we're not taking advantage of what of computing as a medium has to offer. All of them feel very relevant for XR design but The \"Inventing on Principal\" especially so. https://t.co/v2x4sMjr5A\n\u56de\u590d @Heaney555 I'm on the fence about this. Yeah, it looks nice but I'm not to thrilled about paying computational premium for eye candy on hardware that doesn't have much headroom. Also,  if you let the user move everything independently it gets tedious to manage the location of each widget\n\u56de\u590d @nchan Is it the compression artifacts, additional latency, Or just can't get a stable WiFi connection, the reason you feel you need a wired DP connection?  Also, is it just specific use cases or you need it all the time?\n\u56de\u590d @thebroshina @NathieVR Equal to the Quest 3 in terms of processing power and general functionality.  They used cheaper lens, a single display w/ a limited IPD adjustment. The lens are a downgrade but provided your IPD falls  near the average using a single panel shouldn't end up being that big a deal.\n\u56de\u590d @plopesresearch Also, this is really really cool!\n\u56de\u590d @mode7studio It is/can be. Just like many scenes rendered with Cycles at 1 sample could be finished in realtime but when bumped up 1000 probably won't. I assume they are altering specific Lumen parameters to where it's no longer is capable of rendering these specific scene in realtime.\n\u56de\u590d @jozefkrichards It's currently easier/cheaper to train a computer to how to explicitly use a plow than have them independently learn how to do it themselves.\n\u56de\u590d @Gwanatu Yes, I use it and with my library (probably over 40 titles) I'm only aware of one (Onward) not sharing.\n\u56de\u590d @benz145 Your friend/followers can adjust their own privacy settings to where it will affect that sort of thing.\n\u56de\u590d @max_spero_ But I think the idea of that graph is that an AGI wouldn't start over so much as use human level intelligence as its starting point while simply evolving faster as Biological evolution doesn't appear to have an efficiency component.\n\u56de\u590d @Lunayian Curious what you're considering a inaccuracy. The one element that confuses me is the statement that Meta is doing this PCVR updates as a reaction to SteamLink... Such a crazy conclusion to come to, especially considering Meta had to approve SteamLink to be on the store.\n\u56de\u590d @s1ddok How recently did they reject it? If it's been awhile perhaps submit again as with AVP they might have softened their stance on 2D UIs.  Also, I'm curious with the framework you are using can you hide it's \"native androidness\" with a theme? And/or force it to operate in passthru?\n\u56de\u590d @cixliv Lynx R-1 gave devs full access to the raw cameras or is it just you don't consider it a consumer headset?\n\u56de\u590d @JupiIian I'm betting it's a lock easier to hack a more powerful cooling solution than it is to do anything useful with the camera feeds.  https://t.co/EqyWBBksdb\n\u56de\u590d @bozoid Is it only the first time though? It \"remembers you\" (or at least can take advantage of the password manager) after that?\n\u56de\u590d @SkarredGhost @NimaZeighami A professional Basketball player probably isn't going to spend many of nights/weekends playing pickup games at the park. I think it's probably common that the average person working in game dev (not just VR) simply game less than your average gamer.\n\u56de\u590d @jetscott I could see them selling Quest 3 Lite for $199 if you also signup for a 1-2 year subscription of Meta Quest Plus.\n\u56de\u590d @VRDesktop How does it info the user when they get too close to a wall/physical object in a full immersive experience?  Are there situations in mixed reality where a window/UI element blocks your vision enough to walk into something? Or having everything semi transparent prevents it?\n\u56de\u590d @boztank Sure, you could argue it's their problem to figure out how to make their business model work. But I just think you're kinda shooting yourself in the foot by not figuring out good ways to FULLY support alternative services on your platform. Leaves big openings for the competition.\n\u56de\u590d @jozefkrichards Wikipedia isn't a computer. It isn't performing computation. If you want to start comparing things in terms of \"how smart they are\" then you need to look to field of computational theory. But you're going to find expressing it in that way is meaningless.\n\u56de\u590d @HeyNickJohnson People experience less nauseous in AVP because it doesn't really offer the types of experiences (ie using artificial locomotion) that often lead to nausea. It's not superior hardware/software in that regard, but a lack of opportunity to do things that tend to make people sick.\n\u56de\u590d @AndyMorphs @sonicubo I disagree. It'll be a much easier upsell, especially for the laymen. They won't need to resort to selling them specs on paper and how it may or may not affect their uses cases. Just put them in each headset for a minute and it's painfully obvious what your extra money gets you.\n\u56de\u590d @BRabnalt It's better in that the volume is larger and it can leverage hand/arm tracking to make educated guesses when controllers are out of view of a camera. But for games that frequently have you put your controllers in areas that are no longer tracked it certainly can be worse.\n\u56de\u590d @juliendorra Steam did something similar did it not? You had to be approved to get on. Then they had project greenlight to outsource that approval process to a degree. Then they just opened the flood gates and let anything in. They pulled back a little by requiring a small (reimbursable) fee.\n\u56de\u590d @zach_wendt Traditional media in a virtual cinema has way better retention but agree comfort is the major hurdle.I feel 180/360 content retention is more about technical (low res/tons of data, only 3DOF, etc) &amp; artistic (traditional filmmaking technique don't work the same) challenges.", "overlap_score": 0.1819823482683169, "MARITAL": "Never married", "AREA": "Cities", "INCOME": "High Income", "RACE": "White Alone", "EMPLOYMENT": "Working now", "RELIGIOUS": "No religion", "PARTY": "Independent", "AGE": "Youth (18-35 years old)", "IDEOLOGY": "Liberal", "GENDER": "Male"}, {"user_id": 1105917808427352064, "screen_name": "HollywoodYeste1", "user_at_name": "\u2728Hollywood Yesterday\u2728", "sample_content": "\u56de\u590d @Iltriello1966 Love her!

Carly is supposed to be chaotic but her mistakes are blamed on other people and jason ends up fixing it anyway.  What would they do without Sonny/Ava/Nina?  Hug amongst the coffee beans? #GH\nSam involvement was to move the story forward for other people for whatever reasons.  Not sure why it\u2019s being suggested that it\u2019s about her or her kid. #gh\nThe drama was gregory stumbling thru his words &amp; Dex getting beaten after the reception was all but over.  The only people who saw it was jason &amp; kristina so they could continue this bruhaha against Sonny which we are subjected to every other day.  There was nothing to see. #GH\nWhat was to regret? The kid barely gave him a fight before he caved. The kid is so desperate for time with him he\u2019ll take anything. Jason will never work hard for Danny\u2019s trust.  Which could one of two ways \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f #GH\nThen why is anna trying to make dex a cop? Because being a cop makes him less of a target.  Dante isnt in the mob and how often is he threatened by sonny\u2019s enemies?  Jason, however, is currently a target. Jason &amp; Dante are a false equivalency #GH\nI dont normally support mutiny or insubordination but umm, when they get scripts like these, collectively, they should tell the writers &amp; Frank to eat shit.   It\u2019s not even about individual characters. It\u2019s just horrible HORRIBLE writing. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 #gh\n\u56de\u590d Spencer was fixates on Esme, his brother &amp; his relationship.   As much airtime as he had, there was no room for him, apparently, to have casual run ins with other family members to support them. What little airtime his extended family had was geared towards supporting pets #gh\nNAC is talented but Spencer as a character was narrow. He had no aspirations for himself except for vaguely mentioning finding a passion. He was centered around Ace, Trina &amp; Esme. And his father when he was around #gh\n\u56de\u590d @CarolynHinsey I think you were too lenient to be honest. Aside from being a deadbeat, his first instinct parenting his youngest was to ask him to deceive his mother and show teach him about guns.

And i totally forgot she tried to jump off a roof while pregnant.\ud83e\udee4  Look at the end of the day, these writers will have the women looking crazy for aint shit men.\nI think it\u2019s because Jason ditched his kids willingly for carly &amp; he needed an opp to smooth it over.   Sam didnt stop this man from being a father all these years. He wasnt invested in it. He isnt even that much now\ud83d\ude05 suddenly she is a road block to a boy he left behind #GH\n\u56de\u590d @Technologysux He disappears, comes back involved in some violent shit that involves federal charges and asks her kid to lie.

I mean, i dont get her purpose but whatever. #GH\nI wish i cared about Alexis\u2019 potential man friend but i dont\ud83d\ude10 Her getting her license back isnt as dramatic as i thought it would be and NLG has slowly but surely turned me off her as a person.  Le sigh #GH\nThe vibe i got is Sam will go either way. She was honest about her fear but ultimately the choice is Dante\u2019s. #GH\n\u56de\u590d @ELICOLE85 My point is there is no redemption for Jason, Michael &amp; Joss.   That part is skipped over because the writing maintains they didnt do anything wrong.  But if other characters did what they do, they would 100% reap the consequences in some way. That\u2019s my point.\nDidnt dig as deep as i hoped but it is the daily mail\ud83d\ude02  They did better than SOD, SoapHub and Micheal F tho so that\u2019s saying something  lol  I just need PM to talk. 5 months is a long time to observe shit #GH\nHe would never even try\ud83d\ude05But yay, he says one line that he\u2019ll have no intention of following up on in the long term!! #gh\nDidnt see the previews but this is strange. If anything, Spencer would want her to look out for Ace. That would be the better approach\u2026 #GH\nThe kristina stuff is so damn plot point driven.  We saw Kristina drag sonny the day he shot Sonny.  She had a whole reality show based on her being a mob princess.  She was caught in a car bomb set by sonny to kill Johnny.  Korte is the WORST writer and historian\ud83d\ude05 #GH\nKristina knew what she signed up for. They both did.  Why is she shocked her parental rights would be terminated? #gh\nGiving credit where it should go.  None of the dialogue today could have existed without having the writers back then.

What you\u2019ll hear them speak to most is not Faith, but Humanity \u2014 Character.    If you think I\u2019m lying, go and check.  When you marry someone you\u2019re marry their attitude to things.\nHonestly, you\u2019re usually quite distant from any recognition.   Sometimes what you receive in exchange is Profit.

However, there is this unease I feel when the Child is being Cast out with the Mom.  There has to be a better way to address the bond we\u2019ve built with the Child.

Pastoring precedes the Christian Faith:  Whatever Christianity defines a Pastor is simply limited to the edicts of the Christian Faith.  Christianity is a very young religion: it did not birth Pastors.  Pastors birthed Christianity.\n\u56de\u590d @_TENSION_ If he had not been with them, I wouldn\u2019t have know that they were my ancestors.   They were all happy to meet me.

That\u2019s why the Vikings have Valhalla  \u2014 Greeks have Elysium.\n\u56de\u590d @Kenelight Immediately after birth because of the mistakes of midwives.  2 weeks after birth because of the mistakes of midwives.  This will not only ensure that appropriate measures will be meted out to these fraudulent midwives, but will also drastically reduce the cost of DNA \ud83e\uddec tests.\n\u56de\u590d @Wizarab10 Most people don\u2019t know this.   Rich people became Rich by solving objective problems.   When you see a Rich person, they already have a problem they are solving.   This problem they are solving isn\u2019t necessarily their personal problem, but they have to make it personal.\n\u56de\u590d @VictoryOlaleye On the contrary, Scriptures apply to all Religions.
