Contrary to the former twice impeached who is clueless; and has trouble putting a sentence together; the ones that find you guilty or innocent is a JURY!\n\u56de\u590d @RepMTG Absolutely amazing this former twice impeached claims he wants to debate President Biden. He should've learned his lesson in the last Biden debate and ended up looking like a high school dropout.

The Framers' intent for the House was that it would grow as the population grew. Yet, we haven't debated the correct size of the House since the 1920s.   The right to proper representation is vital to our republican form of government.\nSpace tonight cancelled. Must eat and sleep. Rescheduled for Wednesday. Be on the lookout for live update sessions.

We added Hawaii and Alaska as states in 1959, meaning the size of the House briefly increased to 437 seats. However, the Permanent Apportionment Act of 1929 forced the size back to 435 seats and the next apportionment in 1961.\n\"Montana? Great, you get a full vote for or against the measure.    Washington? OK, you get just under three-quarters of a vote.    Idaho? Welp, you get a little over half of a vote.\"    This is the reality of the cap on the House.  Source: https://t.co/Pwd0fjGWbY\n\u56de\u590d @Greyson2020 It absolutely is. The balance between the  Senate and the House (as well as the coequal branches) relies on a growing House as the Founders anticipated.  Furthermore, the massive disparities in congressional sizes between states violates the constitutional principle of \u201cone\u2026\nRepealing and replacing the 1929 Permanent Apportionment act will fix this.

I look forward to teaching more U.S. surveys and my first ever course in spaceflight history!\nDuring his interview for the astronaut class of 1992, Rick Husband said, \"There are a lot of exciting manned space programs in NASA\u2019s future. The Shuttle, Space Station Freedom, establishing a moon base, and the mission to Mars\u2014all will provide fantastic opportunities...\nToday marks the 80th anniversary of one of the most monumental days in the most destructive conflict of the 20th anniversary. What do you believe was the most significant day of the 20th century?  #Twitterstorians\nThis week I have been pleased to begin teaching my first entirely online U.S. History course, for the University of North Georgia.  The subject matter experts have developed intriguing assignments for my students and myself and I am pleased to begin grading them.\nThe passing of our heroes has been all too frequent in recent days.

We will forever be in his debt.\n\u56de\u590d @HerbertHistory If Mattingly had sustained his production from 1984 to 1989 for several additional years, he probably would be in the Hall of Fame.

VR will allow for more portable and less expensive ops.  https://t.co/ovgvBWgv6r\nEvelyn Husband's book High Calling is one of the most emotionally charged books that I have ever read on spaceflight or any other topic.  I have assigned it to students at several institutions, most recently at Bloomsburg University in Pennsylvania.  #Columbia\nLatest book read and reviewed: Challenger by Adam Higginbotham. As a historian, I believe he did a great service to our memory of the accident.  @HigginbothamA   Tyler (Cedar Falls, IA)\u2019s review of Challenger: A True Story of Heroism and Disaster on the Edge of Space | Goodreads\nOne of the most relieving things about spaceflight during the post-shuttle era is that the crew compartment for the Dragon and Soyuz is located above the launch vehicle, so it cannot be damaged by debris falling from the booster.  #Columbia\nOne other question we cannot answer is what course the Space Shuttle program would have taken if it were not for the schedule pressure created by the need to assemble the International Space Station. How would this have affected the response to the foam debris issue?  #Columbia\nScott Parazynski, one of the family escorts for STS-107, once said that Rick's concern for other people was oftentimes greater than for himself. After everything I have read, I find it hard to imagine a better choice to command a space mission than him.   #Columbia\nI wonder how our memory of the accident would be different if people had access to modern smartphone technology in 2003, allowing for the recording of more video footage of the vehicle as it flew above the western United States.  #Columbia\n\u56de\u590d @aidancb8 @__KerryLyn130 No, I'm not joking.  I don't understand why I'm being treated this way.  I'm trying to be a kind person who is willing to congratulate the fans of the winning team, as I have done many times in the past on social media.  I respect the Orioles, as I said originally.\nRick Husband was eager to see human spaceflight progress beyond low Earth orbit, as he said himself during his interview for the astronaut corps during the 1990s. He would have been thrilled to see the Artemis program succeed.   #Columbia\nI remember seeing Clay Anderson's presentation in Waverly, Iowa shortly after the accident happened. His confidence in the program and determination to ride the shuttle when it returned to flight made me feel better as I went through that traumatic period.  #Columbia\nThank you to the World War II Museum for making this historian's first trip to New Orleans such a memorable one today. When asked to explain how the war changed the world, I wrote that it taught people to work together and serve a cause greater than themselves.  @WWIImuseum\nJon Clark said that the chance of death on a shuttle mission was about 1 in 100. In the commercial era of human spaceflight, as seen over four years of Dragon flights, safety has increased while the cost of vehicle development and each flight has decreased greatly.   #Columbia\nLatest book read and reviewed: Every Man a Hero, by Ray Lambert, a medic at Omaha Beach on June 6, 1944.  Tyler (Cedar Falls, IA)\u2019s review of Every Man a Hero: A Memoir of D-Day, the First Wave at Omaha Beach, and a World at War | Goodreads\nThe most striking commonality between the Challenger and Columbia accidents is that both were caused by engineering issues known well in advance and studied extensively. In neither case was the cause an issue that emerged out of the blue on the day of the accident.  #Columbia\nLatest book read and reviewed: The Year That Broke Politics, by Luke A. Nichter.  Tyler (Cedar Falls, IA)\u2019s review of The Year That Broke Politics: Collusion and Chaos in the Presidential Election of 1968 | Goodreads\nThe series describes the revolutionary promise of the shuttle system when it became the first reusable vehicle to send a crew into orbit. I like to tell my students that it brought hope to the United States following recent dispiriting events, such as the Vietnam War.  #Columbia\nWhat is the best book you have read on the history of Hawaii? After watching this video, I am intrigued by the economic, cultural, and political dimensions of the islands.  https://t.co/cB2koxDbig  #Twitterstorians\nOn this International Women's Day, I am thinking about what would have been inconceivable for much of the twentieth century: a NASA astronaut corps with a significant presence of women and women directors of Johnson Space Center, Kennedy Space Center, and Jet Propulsion Lab.\nLatest book read and reviewed: Apollo 1: The Tragedy That Put Us on the Moon, by Ryan Walters. In what direction would the Apollo program have gone if the fire had not taken place?  Tyler (Cedar Falls, IA)\u2019s review of Apollo 1: The Tragedy That Put Us on the Moon | Goodreads\nAlthough there were no planned spacewalks on this mission, David Brown and Mike Anderson did train in the neutral buoyancy lab for an EVA that might prove necessary. What if they had left Columbia's airlock and discovered damage to the left wing?   #Columbia\nToday marks the 80th anniversary of one of the most monumental days of the most destructive conflict of the 20th century. What do you believe was the most significant day of the 20th century?  #Twiterstorians\nNASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe said he was deeply worried about the possibility of shuttle debris injuring people on the ground. One can imagine how those fears would have been manifested if the vehicle had broken apart at a different time or location.  #Columbia\n\u56de\u590d @HerbertHistory @aerohistorian Jason asked about NASA's presence in Florida during the podcast and I just read something interesting about that.

Michelle said to Barack at Parade Review \"All this for a Flag?\" FACT\nBest news in a very long time @RNCResearch @LaraLeaTrump @GOP.

He's one of the so called 'old guard' who is the reason we voted\u2026\nAn independent who's vote means diddly, just someone looking to be smoozed for a vote, because independents are not plentiful enough to give weight to a vote.

Be wary\ud83d\ude4f\nYes indeed &amp; increasingly brash narcissistic enough to open that mouth, swing those arms/hands &amp; point those fingers as she makes absurd accusations as fact.

I do believe you will be\u2026\nOur God &amp; His Son Jesus Christ, Mother Mary, St. Joseph &amp; All Angels &amp; Saints will forever hold McCanna Sinise in their loving care.

We appreciate you!! 1 or 100 items-we are so very thankful!!\nWe could use some good jujus sent our way. The baby had been admitted to the hospital for the beginning stages of pneumonia. His oxygen is low and once he gets on that good oxygen, it\u2019s so hard to ween him off. Hope that you all have a wonderful day. We made it to Friday!! https://t.co/fgXes5g61N\nHi!
