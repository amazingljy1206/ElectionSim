This morning, maybe \ud83e\udd14\n\u56de\u590d @GeraldoRivera He stated that he did not support Putin or what he has done. He really is upstaging the entire MSM. Barbara Walters or Mike Wallace would completely support him. Modern MSM are liars and cowards\nIt\u2019s been happening for millions of years. Like George Carlin always said: \u201cThe earth ain\u2019t going anywhere, we are. The earth is going to shake us off like fleas\u201d.\nTrump says idiotic things sometimes. RFK has done the same. Both are \u201creal\u201d people with great character and of course, human flaws. However, They both love this country enough to risk everything to fight for what it has always stood for. It kind of reminds me of the founding\u2026\nHe is absolutely destroying this state.\n\u56de\u590d @PSchrags Do you think the Falcons might actually make a move for Cousins, and grab a guy like Penix?   I hear Cousins to Falcons Heated up at the combine.

They have no clue what that means. They are hell bent on destroying this country. Honestly, supporting them at this point is treason.

I have voted for Democrats and Republicans my entire life. Whoever I think will serve us all best is who I look for. Unless it\u2019s a cocktail party, it\u2019s a cult\u2026\n\u56de\u590d @XVanFleet @ACTBrigitte The absolute worst kind of Human\n\u56de\u590d @abc7newsbayarea And restaurants will start laying off and closing location within six months. Total \ud83e\udd21 show\nAnd that\u2019s a big problem for America. The MSM, legacy media, whatever you call them. They are the greatest threat to democracy. Why do we allow this? Why is nobody in government trying to stop this?\n\u56de\u590d @Twolfrecovery @X We are living in terrifying times.

And as usual, \ud83d\udcaf at taxpayer expense while our roads fall apart. Keep voting from these evil clowns and nothing will be left for us.\n\u56de\u590d @Everett_G07 I really think AS isn\u2019t a bad coach. RM was very similar the first go around. Sometimes getting humbled has a very positive long term affect.\nI support your decision \ud83d\udcaf and find it sad, and actually sickening, that people put party before the hood of the people. 600 meters of high speed rail has already cost fifteen billion dollars. Why? Where did all that money go? VOTE TRUMP\n\u56de\u590d @Jason Freaking unbelievable. They either allowed it to happen or it\u2019s the greatest failure in SS history.
