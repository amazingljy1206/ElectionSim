Yildiz is another example.\nI expect UCLA fans to obsess over Purdue basketball once they move to the new conference.\nAn Italian Renaissance.\nIf a writer uses Generative AI to turn a few bullet points into a few paragraphs and the reader then uses Gen AI to turn the paragraphs into digestible bullet points, why don't we just skip the middle step?\nI love the last guy.\nI think Trump's campaign leaked cherrypicked emails to Politico.

Also handled the Sean Miller situation badly.\n\u56de\u590d @Matt_Santangelo The difference last year could be chalked down \u2014 at least partly \u2014 to differences in play styles between the two teams. Also, Giroud, much as I love him, was slow and missed a lot too. Thought he was good with headers.\nThis is not 2016.  1. Dems are more united now.

Only liars are scared to speak under oath.  You will find out very soon.\n\u56de\u590d @SpeakerJohnson Tell us more about the bottom of the deck... https://t.co/Uo5kjoq0mB\n\u56de\u590d @FFT1776 This isn't hard...   Trump cheated on his wife with a pornstar, then paid her to keep quiet, and fraudulently hid the payments.  He's on tape, he signed the checks, and his own friend testified against him.   #GUILTY\n\u56de\u590d @TradingThomas3 Target CPI is 2%.

Some of the outer residential and industrial/post industrial bits feel less safe.\n\u56de\u590d @Digforgold1 @chrislepkowski Performing arts, theatres, music venues etc make cities vibrant and attract people to visit them, live there, spend money there, contribute to them.  They create a real buzz but also generate significant economic activity, directly &amp; indirectly. Slashing funding is a big loss\n\u56de\u590d @RajShar62817205 @thebathams You're not wrong. But hang on, with your name and being a Burnley fan and talking black country stuff..   did you used to work at a catalogue shop in a town beginning with H?\n\u56de\u590d @SMGlookalike @OldStationSt @lisanandy @DCMS @RhonddaBryant @BFI @Cllr_suleman @David4BKH @gardensinboots @RichParkerLab @andy4wm @AlistairCarns Two very different buildings, both deserving of historical preservation.  The brutalist version just needed some love and investment and perhaps some remodelling or demolition of the buildings immediately adjacent to it. The area immediately surrounding it let it down\n\u56de\u590d @H_H_Gray Compare/contrast with the public spaces in any Dutch city.  Last year I took my kids to a playground in Birmingham I went to as a kid in the 80s/90s.  Same play equipment there still, looked as if it had not been painted in 15 years. In NL public stuff gets maintained &amp; updated.\n\u56de\u590d @Barney__Coleman @juvehearts @medwaymakem @crimlawuk It's not ironic. easyJet operate within a semi-functional marketplace. You can choose from different airlines, routes etc.  you can't however send two competing trains down one track.  Nor can you choose your water provider.  These are monopolies captured for profit gouging\n\u56de\u590d @bancroft_mathew @SpannersReady Yeah not in favour of the danger part but if the unpredictability in performance can come back without tyres exploding it could be interesting\n\u56de\u590d @drjenwolkin if everyone had one leg, then having one leg would not be considered a disability.  Despite that, having one leg would still be incredibly restrictive.  My ADHD may be worsened by NT expectations &amp; standards, but they didn't create it, &amp; their absence wouldn't help it.\n\u56de\u590d @chrislepkowski I have the impression that things were very well managed behind the scenes, see the psychological measures taken re. Penalties.  It may be that he would be better suited in more of an analytical or technical support role than having full responsibility as head coach.\n\u56de\u590d @mitrebarnet @TracyEglin @campbellclaret The EU did not put any conditions in place. We quit the free trade agreement without a plan.  If people who wanted Brexit gave a crap about business in the UK they should have had a plan on how they would maintain frictionless trade with their biggest market.\n\u56de\u590d @supertanskiii Yeah but the nature of FPTP means they don't get a sniff of power in any case. Electoral and constitutional reform should be high on Starmer's priorities if he wins a whopping great majority.  It won't be though.\n\u56de\u590d @PaoloWalnuts Missile.  Baggies have scored some absolute belters in recent weeks that feel uncharacteristically Albion based on recent seasons\n\u56de\u590d @BradleyPhilpot That looks intense. Most of the go karts I've been in at turn up and drive type places have had so little grip that you barely feel any g-force.  It was a shock to me when I had a go in one with some actual grip that I had to strain to keep myself upright in the corners!\n\u56de\u590d @cjeam @Laura_W_Gieseke @clhubes No, there isn't a balance. You can't predict how a baby reacts to being on a flight, because they're a baby.  Babies are just as entitled to fly as adults. Crying children on flights are irritating, but you can wear earplugs.  It's far, far worse for the parents of the kid crying\n\u56de\u590d @CyberPunkCortes @wasnt__me_ Anything more than a limited strike of 1 or 2 bombs would cause complete societal breakdown. The systems we rely on for food production, power, drinking water, medicine would disappear.  Society would regress to a lawless violent fight for survival. Some fetishize this prospect.\n\u56de\u590d @Beej_JJJ @RainbowChazer @tonkerthomas Not aware of any element of neurodivergence which means one needs to irritate other people with sounds from a phone.  If anything ND peeps are more likely to be aware of how sound can cause other ppl discomfort and sensory stress\n\u56de\u590d @Russ4Northbrook @mckenzie_sohan @Layo_FH There's no ideology in NL re bikes. The Dutch cycle because they realised it's cheap &amp; convenient. They are one of the most pragmatic folk on earth, not ideological at all.  That's actually you. Of course they move home using removals firms with big lorries &amp; shipping containers.\n\u56de\u590d @BradleyPhilpot Hearing Queen in the trailer cemented my suspicions that this film is going to be a stinker \ud83d\udca9\ud83d\udca9 of a film\n\u56de\u590d @nimrodson @dange82 @SportmphMark @Jayhassett You're interpreting a legal text &amp; making an argument whilst not understanding the text. There was no ambiguity in the rules.  The stewards relied on Red Bull's objection to Mercedes' appeal in their decision.  Upholding that decision and braking the rules created ambiguity.\n\u56de\u590d @Bob_London_ @CoastalNorther1 @arleneseesit Point is very clear.  The person bought their house earning below average wages and with a mortgage of 2.5 times their salary.  That has been impossible for a long time and house buying is becoming a privilege of the wealthy or those with financial support from their parents.\n\u56de\u590d @Burt_Bondi @Jimbo_Preston @anon_opin I can see that might work at a steady constant velocity on a motorway.  In an urban environment with frequent stopping and starting accelerating up to 50 to then have to frequently stop is going to be far worse on fuel than going more slowly.\n\u56de\u590d @DudeAdhd @RadicalLabGeek Indeed.  And yes, a rich child with well educated parents who understand ADHD are less likely to end up in crime than a poor one with badly educated parents etc.  but the rich one still has a heightened predisposition towards behaviours that may lead them to commit crime\n\u56de\u590d @TobiFrenzen @mrianleslie Has anyone been able to verify how he eats a bacon sandwich yet?\n\u56de\u590d @iainlee I can initially picture something in my mind, sort of. But then it very quickly fades away and the more I try to focus on it the faster it goes.  I also can't draw to save my life - not sure if that's related to this or dyspraxia/dysgraphia, or a bit of each combined.\n\u56de\u590d @a_h_reaume Either can be productive, enjoyable &amp;  powerful but also exhausting (afterwards), stressful, &amp; detrimental to the many demands of adult life. When really hyperfocused on meds I'll avoid going to toilet until it hurts to avoid breaking focus.\n\u56de\u590d @f1_editor @nettocharrua @JennaFryer Calling it an internal matter doesn't change anything once it's become public news\n\u56de\u590d @youngdand @ClimateFirst2 @Secret_Squidgle @RichardJMurphy @UKLabour Well exactly.
