Previous correspondence  2. Double opt in  3. Same email client (Google to Google, Microsoft to Microsoft, etc)\nDuplicates in your CRM will absolutely destroy you if it get\u2019s out of hand. Pull all your contacts and companies every 90 days.   Sort the Name column in alphabetical order. Tag duplicates true/false based on exact matches.

You\u2019re not getting ghosted, people have no idea you\u2019re even trying to reach them. So much of our business is fixing this for brokers\nSteps to a CRM Audit:  1. Duplicates: multipoint tagging for contacts, accounts, and properties (CRE folks). CRMs like HubSpot only use exact name and website url, this isn't good enough (Apple vs Apple Inc). Every duplicate is a massive risk to your business\n\u201cStrategy\u201d roles at early stage startups = tits on a bull\n\u56de\u590d @bhalligan HubSpot covers 80% of your sales enablement needs.

Will you defend their honor?\n\u56de\u590d @themartinroth @CREXinc Very few use a CRM. Most don't have an automated, functioning inbound flow. Even fewer use a VA/EA, and the Jr. Broker (if they have one) obviously won't have access to the email/VM. We spend our days fixing this\nDuplicates can destroy your business.  One partner had three duplicates of a single contact at a single account. The first time they called, the prospect asked to be out on the DNC. Problem was that note was logged to ONLY one of the records. Long story short, the prospect\u2019s\u2026\n\u56de\u590d @thesamparr @FreightAlley What's the biggest mistake he's ever had to bounce back from?\n\u56de\u590d @BenWilsonTweets The OG cougar tamer.

Bet she doesn\u2019t mention \u201ccondoms\u201d or \u201cabstinence\u201d or the longterm outcomes of previous STD infection, and instead suggests \u201chand hygiene\u201d\n\u56de\u590d @scott_squires It\u2019s insane. I saw an @nyulangone cardiologist post covid.  Not one masked dr/nurse. Doctor gave me brief talk re: \u201cCovid exposure may be good\u201d \ud83e\udd2f.

What would they do if black students were assaulted because of their race? Would those behaviors be tolerated? Absolutely disgraceful\n\u56de\u590d @RachelBitecofer @MeidasTouch You mean like how Biden\u2019s CDC lied about vaccine breakthrough infections and told Americans they could be indoors together unmasked if vaccinated? Or how Biden &amp; his CDC lied about COVID being \u201cmild\u201d, while even mild infections are causing Long COVID &amp; systemic organ damage?\n\u56de\u590d @realchrisrufo These corporations mirror elite college admissions: only DEI and ultra rich, super connected white kids are admitted.

Ditto for the company they keep.\n\u56de\u590d @complainster @StopAntisemites @Penn @CornellCALS @Columbia @Harvard @Cornell They have their own.

They could have continued to share info: cdc got rid of accurate positivity maps, hid all data, have not informed the public about the damage that even \u201cmild\u201d Covid infections can inflict, @CDCDirector NEVER masks, etc. Inexcusable.\n\u56de\u590d @QueenMab87 Only antisemites chant that antisemitic phrase\n\u56de\u590d @EYakoby @Penn The rot runs deep and wide at @penn these days\u2014their Admissions Director changed several years ago to someone very liberal, because that was au current at the time of her hire.
