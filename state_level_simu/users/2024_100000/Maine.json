This is what prompted H\u2019s Visa to be under legal review by a US court.\n\u56de\u590d @SerAemond Financial Times  article 2016, \u201c Before she met Murphy, Wallis heard he was worried they hadn\u2019t cast an Irish actress as Grace. \u201cI can stand my ground, she says, but it was a relief when they hit it off.\u201d Another Wallis interview she said when she 1st met Otto he told her Cillian\n\u56de\u590d @Nat_m0_rr1 @sage1411 Technically M can retain title until H remarries. But do children retain titles or LoS in divorce?\n\u56de\u590d @dc70793 @Jensiphone M was on Deal No Deal 2006/2007. Her timeline after high school is pretty non existent. Joe Giuliano has only admitted he knew M as students in NW. Given pics M has had # exes. But kid rumours have persisted over time but who really knows.\n\u56de\u590d @Belriver32 @the_royal_rogue July 2018 Wimbledon There\u2019re # articles picked up this royal visit &amp; hat issue. VIP level is not as steep grading as upper sections so hats block views. No one is wearing hats in VIP box.\n\u56de\u590d @MurkyMegPodcast As American citizen residing in US 5 yrs can  donate $. To openly campaign for political party cannot use titles as US constitution doesn\u2019t recognize noble titles.\n\u56de\u590d @MeghansMole Add to that H\u2019s US  Entry Visa Application is under review.\n\u56de\u590d @ShoveOnByrne @MurkyMegPodcast World Bank estimates poverty rate 38.9% in 2023, 2nd largest poor pop after India. Nigeria Advisory Council puts total dept profile to $81 billion in 2022. Revenue loss due to pipeline theft &amp; vandalism, sabotage, national &amp; foreign gov\u2019t corruption. Revenue dependent on exports\n\u56de\u590d @punkfrenchtoast Chris also moved to Universal other than % payout as they gave him total creative control, $200 mil budget. good film marketing campaign, a theatre release.\n\u56de\u590d @LauraBockov Consign them to Vintage Retail Store\u2026someone may find it fun to wear them rather than tuck them away in storage.\n\u56de\u590d @longsally 43% tribal Nigerian leaves 57%. Malta was British colony but Historically &amp; Culturally more closely tied to Italy. Allegedly at NW M told classmates she was Italian descent. Joe Giuliano was from trad Italian family. Markle Sr claimed Irish Dutch German descent.\n\u56de\u590d @BarkJack_ Will she now be hired for the Duchy of Lancaster?\n\u56de\u590d @Bren526Martin @TheFakeDuchess Constitutional Monarchy is also known as Limited Monarchy, Parliamentary Monarchy, or Democratic Monarchy.\n\u56de\u590d @cill_i_am Was Cillian\u2019s GQ photo shoot Versace\u2019s precursor to their male icon campaign w Cillian\u2019s signing?\n\u56de\u590d @SabirahLohn H &amp; Invictus are the sideshow. H\u2019s presence is only needed to give reason for the wife\u2019s attendance. M is just one time USO tour participant, never served but yet takes front &amp; center at Invictus.\n\u56de\u590d @kelly1952 @MeghansMole M usually wears 4\u201d \ud83d\udc60 to add to her true 5\u20194\u201d height &amp; make her legs look longer. A older resume she claimed to be a supermodel &amp; legs her best feature. Diana was 5\u201910\u201d.  PoW is 5\u20199\u201d.\n\u56de\u590d @MurkyMegPodcast M  was 6th on call sheet for Suits. H was  6th in LoS when M married him &amp; QE11 was Queen. She strutted around like a diva being 6th. How her ego has grown when 6th no longer is enough despite her lack of achievements.\n\u56de\u590d @mog1717 @UKRoyalGossip There was Trooping the Colour balcony gathering when M tried to push her way to stand beside QE11 but was blocked by Anne, Andrew. M then kept turning around asking H to move to stand other side of balcony by Kate/William. H just told her twice to turn around &amp; look forward.\n\u56de\u590d @lalaroze2012 @TheFakeDuchess Punched photographer in face causing damage, drunk at friend\u2019s pool party pushed females fully dressed into pool, dad set him to rehab for drug/drinking problem, naked pool party in Vegas, calling fellow soldier \u201cPaki\u2019, Art teacher did his project for him, visible spur injuries\n\u56de\u590d @sage1411 H\u2019s Visa immigration status is under review soon. Is H setting up narrative in case his US residency bc limited or status altered?\n\u56de\u590d @psychociller Cillian is collaborating w Max Porter on Steve script an adaption of Porter\u2019s Shy. They\u2019ve reversed the story to be a Teacher not youth offender. Cillian\u2019s Big Small Things Co is one of the producers.\n\u56de\u590d @MurkyMegPodcast Best comment is from Sarah Vine\u2026 Nigeria was a Presidential Tour for Meg while H stood in the backgrd in supporting role.\n\u56de\u590d @MurkyMegPodcast It wasn\u2019t a royal tour. They aren\u2019t working royals. They don\u2019t receive money from Sovereign Grant or rep the monarchy. If concerned abt protocols perhaps focus disregarding cultural &amp; social norms of dress, rude behaviour exhibited, vulgar display of jewellery among high poverty.\n\u56de\u590d @PeakyRianna Given Tom Shelby\u2019s mementos of past life burned in caravan &amp; white horse, he enters new journey. S6 ends 1933. WW11 declared 1939 when Knight said story ends w war. Expect Knight will have Tom receive his redemption thru death.\n\u56de\u590d @nancytsidley @StephanieSidley Well it continues to be grt flag to RF  H not to be trusted. Backgrid knew his arrival time &amp; where to position photographer for the pic. H even made sure all press knew he was mting KC111.\n\u56de\u590d @BarkJack_ It\u2019s smaller details that KC will want to finalize &amp; for his legacy; favourite charities ensured, personal land holdings not of duchy, the Lodge issue w bro, new land projects started at Sandringham, his environmental &amp; Prince Trust expansion goals, personal papers/journals etc.\n\u56de\u590d @PeakyRianna Matt Damon co-producer STLT said festival run &amp; EU distributors might be best route first. Jeanne du Barry  film had success going that way. Expect STLT will be part of Cork Film Festival in November.\n\u56de\u590d @SerAemond Knight said he wanted someone with acting experience to cast as Grace &amp; liked Wallis\u2019 body of work. The only point of concern for him was her ability to do the accent.\n\u56de\u590d @Fibutton M had gate crashed the wedding event. M only stayed one day. Arrived in someone\u2019s private jet from Toronto but left by commercial airline next day. The woman is a guest who joined their table when H was visibly upset.\n\u56de\u590d @sage1411 Is this a half in/out tour? Photo ops, flashing titles while making back room deals for personal benefit?
