However, unless things change and Fanos stop acting like 18th century warlords, we won't see the defeat of our enemies. The other overlooked aspect is the people and how long before they get tired of things because all they see is disunity without end.\nYou're a very good actress who should have been on this years oscar nomination list. Acting like you and your team isn't behind so much of the division that has crippled diaspora Amhara from doing their part in the struggle, well played\ud83c\udfc6! Sadly, you can't fool everyone.\n\u56de\u590d @yeEnemay One thing that hasn't changed in Amhara circles on this platform and elsewhere is lack of insight and lack of interest to listen to those with one. The end result is repeating the same circle of \u1305\u1265 \u12a8\u1204\u12f0 \u12cd\u123b \u132e\u12b8!\n\u56de\u590d @yeEnemay In my four years on this platform, i have not seen a more disheartning and painful time than right now. Even worse than watching my family live through war in realtime and the painful time where Amhara genocide was at its peak. But we must hold keep on strong &amp; help preserve\u2026\n\u56de\u590d @awodaje Because the discourse was given a village dimention for some time, i don't think it is fair to accuse people who now view it that way. It can't be just coincidence that there are hardly any voices from Gojjam who oppose team Zemene's approach. Instead all the evidence suggests\u2026\n\u56de\u590d @awodaje Because i think you are well informed on the matter than I am. I'd like to understand the position people take vis-a-vis their local interest.\nThis week alone, more than a hundred Amhara civilians were gunned down indiscriminately by the fascist oromo government as the world looks in silence. We are on our own. All focus should be on helping Fano defeat the fascist regime. #MerawiMassacre  #AmharaGenocide https://t.co/iknjWSYA0z\n\u56de\u590d Instead they elevate everyone who has wronged the Amhara people without demanding accountability or any form of justice to the many victims as long as they get to exploit the individual for their gains. \u12e8\u12f0\u121d \u1290\u130b\u12f4\u12ce\u127d!! They don't care one bit about Amhara people!\n\u56de\u590d @meshwalekia Exactly! And what is even more sad is you don't even have to be Amhara or believe in the cause to be front and center in the struggle of our people. Remember Hermela? She wasn't Amhara but majority of her support came from Amharas in the diaspora. It just makes me sick.\n\u56de\u590d @DestaAmora2648 You are not Amhara nationalist. You don't even see the 15% Amharas who are Muslim  as Amhara. And anyone who tries to overlook what Tigres did during the war and the last 50 years is an enemy to Amhara people!!\n\u56de\u590d @Amharafirst88 ...and interests secured within the framework of the Ethiopian state.\n\u56de\u590d @addisinsight Yuri \u12c8\u122c \u130b\u130b\u122a*\n\u56de\u590d @wediHama30523 @DuchessOfGonder Lalibela is Amhara-Agew heritage. Introduce what you have such as Debre Bizen to the rest. Don't claim something that isn't your history. Besides you can't tell us how much you are different historically, culturally and politically from Ethiopia and still claim things you like.\n\u56de\u590d @Amharafirst88 Most Amharas are mainly concenred about how hard life has become &amp; the state of the struggle they support. I don't think the provincial/regional administration issue is in their mind nor in most Fanos. The reality on the ground is very different from what is portrayed here.\n\u56de\u590d What all these tiktok strippers &amp; vultures haven't done in their youth, Eskindir is doing in his 50s. To oppose his political stance is one thing, as i have done many times before, but to try &amp; assasinate the character of a man who is fighting for his people is beyond repugnant!\n\u56de\u590d @hzenemay @Embi_belu I think my observation is correct\ud83d\ude02\n\u56de\u590d @Amharafirst88 put the interests of the people first and treat all Amharas equally. The only major contest for power at this moment should be with the regime not amongst Fano leaders. Anyone with the above qualities should be allowed to lead as long as they have large scale support among Fanos\n\u56de\u590d @naty__x2 \u120d\u12ad \u1290\u12cd\u1362  So demoratic of our stupid diasporas who live in democratic countries to reject a majority vote by Fanos themselves.\n\u56de\u590d @yeEnemay What is both sad and funny is they don't have unity amongst themeselves not even at a zonal level.\n\u56de\u590d @yeEnemay @ruhama_m_belay This woman who uses third person grammar to address Amharas sees herself as  sophisticated &amp; enlightened\ud83d\ude02\n\u56de\u590d @TeferaTsegereda And i don't think he is pure Amhara either.\n\u56de\u590d @meshwalekia No idea. But i noticed most of them are not from the Amhara region thus have no direct connection to the people who are suffering. This explains why they are too callous to the real damage they are causing.\n\u56de\u590d It was clear diasporas were trying to buy their own Fano groups instead of helping them come together. With this division, Amhara people will remain slaves to hostile groups &amp; system for generations to come unless things change now. https://t.co/mz08QFQtHX\n\u56de\u590d @Locati0ns Ethiopia gained independence in 1270 from whom? There is no such thing. That year marks the restoration of the Solomonic Dynasty.\n\u56de\u590d @chalederebe29 @Semu2021 \u130e\u1320\u129d\u1290\u1275 is disgusting and primitive.\n\u56de\u590d @chalederebe29 @Semu2021 You can't see the thing that is now your conrnerstone. Very few defend/prop up/give cover to their respective village leaders as much as you do. Btw, we all have those in our respective areas we can prop up but for people who have chose a bigger identity that's meaningless.\n\u56de\u590d @yeEnemay I mean honestly\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83d\ude02 I had so much hope in many who i thought believed in a pure form of nationalism one that puts the Amhara people and their interests front and center, prioritizes tasks, and follows a pragmatic approach to achive goals. But what i have seen is the opposite.\n\u56de\u590d @Amharafirst88 You claim to be Amhara first. Yet your focus is on putting down the side you oppose instead of the people's interest which is setting aside political differences and finishing the job of liberating them from the regime. Try to put the Amhara people first if you truly care.\nIt may seem the atrocious sm campaigns targeting Eskindir are just about him. But their goal is to destroy the Amhara struggle. They want tested and respected leaders on the ground like Col. Fantahun Muhabaw out!  https://t.co/RLfUXM2bEw\n\u56de\u590d @BlenAmhara One group attacks Eskindir day &amp; night, mainly backed by diaspora orgs with ADP elements; the other group reacts to counter the attacks, not worship as i see it. The solution is simple, stop the shameless attacks.

Looks awesome!\n\u56de\u590d @burnerac78281 @KevinCo40442104 @fuzzymittens This sounds like an absolute wet dream for all the US's health insurance companies. They already try as hard as they possibly can to NOT offer coverage or authorization for medical procedures and prescription of medications. This is just going to embolden them even more.\n\u56de\u590d But if any of those steps were lied about or avoided - like you didn't wear a condom, you've broken the legal agreement and are legally bound to pay child support, no ifs or buts, no walking away.

That was my last night at a club lol\n\u56de\u590d @JamesMelville It's not really public land at that point either. I don't think you'd be welcome to take a stroll amongst the windmills.

The vaccine is the public announcement that the cops are looking for a person and showing their description. The more people who see that warning, the less areas that person can hide, the fewer victims of his there are.\n\u56de\u590d @Lilith_Atheist @Askwhyisit Why make the \"tree of knowledge\" something edible at all?

Realise centralised food systems can't cope and beg everyone to grow their own to help out. - It works. History is made. Government immediately forgets valuable lesson and re-centralises food supply.\n\u56de\u590d @benonwine The Charter itself makes no sense now. It did back in the day, when the BBC was literally the only TV company. If they went under then TV itself would have died. That hasn't been the case in forever.\n\u56de\u590d @LA_Knight89 @JenLRossman This doesn't SOUND so bad, until you realise the massive blood pressure increase to the heart, lungs and brain, combined with the shutting down of kidneys, liver and intestines can actually be fatal. A warm blanket stops this happening and helps brain chemicals return to normal.\n\u56de\u590d @AfterpsycH The US government keeps claiming it's all about National Security. So why don't they use some of the National Security or Military budget to literally just start their own and copy TikToks code? Run it off US servers? Not like China has the right to object.\n\u56de\u590d @MadHatterMommy Yes. Well, I do. Problem is, it's really hard to appreciate it when the lady is a total stranger, without looking like an absolute creep. So you just gotta take the briefest of \"glimpses\" (is there a word for this but for smells rather than sights?) and not visually react.\n\u56de\u590d @xintanifae I felt the same way about our goofy Golden Retriever.

He's got access to all of the images of their slaughtered child victims, surely he can do this?

They're already being as ridiculous as possible.  You are a caricature of yourself. You're a self-parody. You're the butt of your own joke that you can't even understand.  Hasbara Nazis are impossible to parody. https://t.co/kpCYHVReCA\nPeople with 'husband/dad/mum/wife' in their bio are surely the psychoest of creeps.

Pathetic.\n\u56de\u590d @OnlyAWorldAway @UncoordinatedB lol touch\u00e9. if it was just an endurance competition I've got more time playing this game against fascists than anything on steam, but I honestly don't think I'm childish or petty enough to try out rules lawyer it with someone I actually had intellectual respect for earlier today\n\u56de\u590d @Equality7d2521 @yumcoconutmilk Oh damn. I wanted you to think the constitution protects speech but you got me.  It's a pity the 1st amendment only applies to people who you haven't accused of whatever catchphrase the MSM told you to use today.

Oh yeah that was now. @Rustinyoureye is in custody for that right now. https://t.co/bsCMTVTcD4\n\u56de\u590d @McShayne2011 Lobbying? All of the millions who witnessed these horrors have been shaken so far out of their comfort zone that we'll see people do extreme acts of disruption for the rest of our lives until the system ends.  History is replete with examples of where this is inevitably leading.\n\u56de\u590d @NY_LBS @OnlyAWorldAway \ud83d\ude02 I thought this was a joke at first but then I looked at your account and realized you're serious and that's even funnier \ud83e\udd23\n\u56de\u590d @expedtadam They should enjoy it while they can.
