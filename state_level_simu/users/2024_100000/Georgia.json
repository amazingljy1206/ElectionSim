There is nothing in the cosmos beyond the gods, every being is within them. Properly speaking, everything is them. Nothing can be without them or in some way contrary, because existence itself is predicated upon being.\nhttps://t.co/E4dJY4m7gV The concern is not whether something is participating 'perfectly,' but rather if the life would be capable of pursuing its spiritual telos.

That this uranium reserve is practically exclusively exploited for the benefit of mining magnates that pay minimal taxes and fees and employ so few people is embarrassing statecraft and appalling national management.\n\u56de\u590d Now to return to the excerpt. Firstly, we established earlier that \"goodness\" is the essence of being. The gods are the first of beings, making the summit of goodness as it can be known. This also makes them the unity of goodness, as there are no other beings before them.\n\u56de\u590d @neoamericana Invention of State Shinto which was wielded against Japan to debase the unity of religion with the Japanese state by depicting it a mere product of cynical utility, and thus justify cleaving religion from the public realm in pursuit of dismantling fascism, seems very intentional.\n\u56de\u590d I will end my response here. Concerning John's various mythic examples, my reply is simply that myth is analogical theology. The mundane activities of the gods within myth are intended to convey an occult reality, just as the cosmos conveys the occult reality of the gods.\n\u56de\u590d @ProfMoriarty_Py Gods don't derive their power from the death of followers.\n\u56de\u590d And to expand upon this, such is the importance of funerary rituals. The acts we take with our dead is to aid the dead; all of it is to remind them of their path forward and to liberate them from their old, dead life.\nThis is an example of how modern atheism is really a form of Yahwism. Atheism, despite a supposed lack of belief in any religion, regularly imposes upon religion theological conventions that are accordant with Yahwism.\n\u56de\u590d While an ethical judgement may struggle to reconcile the good of each per John's example, a moral judgement considers the good of the whole. In this instance, with account for the interplay of factors that constitute a healthy ecosystem, one would judge the chase as morally good.\n\u56de\u590d @TheUnshavedOne \"Bro we surveyed pagan communities that are pro-LGBTQ+, amazing that they are pro-LGBTQ+.\"  Not a real survey. I also don't care about America. By the same study, more than half of Christians support LGBTQ+. The US is doomed.\n\u56de\u590d @KeithWoodsYT It's because they've already won the white karens that would lean right. Trump's supporters are fanatical and don't need convincing, they're utterly unwavering. Trump needs the swing voters if he wants to win, which is likely what she meant rather than it being a race preference.\n\u56de\u590d @Praetor_Gaius This isn't to be taken as a reality that happened or will happen. Myth is theological allegory.\n\u56de\u590d @JYMGJurista This is what makes it a powerful weapon. I've not played it (not due to being eternally based, but simply didn't catch my interest), but of course in this sea of big publishers delivering trash and boring games, the one game that is well-polished and widely well-received is this.\n\u56de\u590d @GeorgiaBoy747 @auseronearth Monogamy was standard in Rome and Greece. Christianity's association with monogamy is an accident of its Europran adoption; nothing in the Bible prohibits polygamy.\nGaze upon evil and see its ugliness. Know it for the sake of ridiculing it. Intimation is not love necessarily, but knowing. Then you reject and revile it. Evil is thrown to Hades, allowed for him to disintegrate it into oblivion. By this, we become greater. Succumb, and you die.\nPeople seem to really miss the point that what BAP, REN, etc. promote is subversive, and the reason why it is important to reveal that they've been deceptive about who they are is to make evident that they are liars. But foolishly, many loyalist idiots are instead doubling down.\n\u56de\u590d @PDXVictoria The game asks me to fill in the fantasy and create my own fun far too frequently. Yes, I can \"imagine\" that the loading bars represent construction or parliamentary politicking, but practically, they all just involve me waiting around waiting for them to fill up.\nIt was never really my intent to just be a hostile and polemical account that does nothing but make anti-Christian posts. Within short time, I do intend to return to making meaningful theology posts.  Unfortunately, it is hard NOT to engage in polemics when ignorance is arrogant.\n\u56de\u590d What is sad is that we fought against the great nation of Japan. What is sad is that we fought against the great nation of Germany. What is sad is that we fought against great Europe. Pray that we might fight better soon.\n\u56de\u590d @Anthesteria12 It's a distressing alienation of Venus from personal love. The fact he begins by referring to his wife as \"beautiful,\" ergo primarily rooted in her appearance, he must think of her vainly as a love rooted in how appealing she is to him.\n\u56de\u590d ...it is interested purely in the export of these goods and is disinterested actively in the utilisation of these goods for the good of Australia.\n\u56de\u590d However, in keeping with their divine intent, the gods will pursue the expansion of goodness wheresoever it may be expanded. It must be reminded that this is not moral goodness, but substantive goodness.\n\u56de\u590d These too hence become a target- not because of a blood hatred for Christ, but because in the Messianic age, all gentiles are to rely upon the children of Israel as the sole means through whom they're to have connection with God, dependent entirely upon them as divine conduits.\nJudaic fear of the swastika speaks of its power, and of the typhonic essence of their race. They view the sacred symbol as anathematic because they are antithetical to what it represents: the cosmos and divine power.  Unfortunately for them, both are eternal and omnipotent.\nOne of the most insane things I've encountered on this site is Christians challenging people like myself to say \"Christ is King\" because they believe Jews/demons literally cannot say it.  The Yahweh-induced schizophrenia is intense.\n\u56de\u590d Yahwism is already latent in many cases, and it need only be \"activated.\" This is the case because Yahwism feeds upon primal fears and emotions, which it experly exploits.

I gave up my car long ago. &gt;6\n\u56de\u590d @SteveLovesAmmo Trump told us to wear masks and all the rest for respiratory viruses AND he is the one that pushed for the vaccines to go through rapidly, and he also was one of the first to take monoclonal antibodies by IV when he got COVID (and he signed an EUA to take them).&gt;\n\u56de\u590d @HouseGOP And it is you clowns in the GOP House who have tried to impeach Biden on his orders, with information from Putin's propaganda file.

That alone is a disgrace to Americans values.\n\u56de\u590d @SenSchumer Dang we have to get into politics to see how America is so strong, cuz as a middle class family it\u2019s not showing in our world, as our saving dwindle cuz of how high prices are, and owe yeah no one can afford to buy a house. How bout get out here &amp; do some research, or spare us.\n\u56de\u590d @LakeLouise1988 @JoeyMannarinoUS Trump was liable for sexual assault, the rape was thrown out with the lesser charge, payday 83 million, the sexual assault charge paid 5 million. Why is this not fishy to u when the lesser offense paid more. It does not smell right but it\u2019s trump so Dems say he\u2019s guilty.\n\u56de\u590d @krassenstein Radical Harris is like a buffalo she is not a born leader, in fact she\u2019s a sequin personality the worst person to lead. Convict Trump is like an Eagle, he is a born leader, it why he is so successful, in fact a Cleric personality the best persons to lead. So I\u2019m going with Trump.\n\u56de\u590d @Spawn_03 Lmao no capital police died only a trump supporter did. So many lies out their bout jan 6. It was never a blood bath like democrats lead u to believe. The only corruption in America is the Biden administration, That\u2019s why they keep ur eyes on trump with be charge. Wake up\n\u56de\u590d @joncoopertweets The 1 on the left hasn\u2019t fought nothing in 50 years. So the only logical choice is the 1 on the right. Dems are above the law &amp; never go on trial, the other keeps getting put on trial but wins his case. So I\u2019m not for a 2 tiered justice system &amp; being ok with it is disgraceful.\n\u56de\u590d @mommamia1217 @TristanSnell Actually it all been public for 9 years, how come we hear only about Republicans, but democrats stuff is swept under the rug. Oh yeah we have a two tier justice system, if you are republicans it\u2019s made public, but if u are democrats it\u2019s hid from the public. So wake\n\u56de\u590d @marlene4719 Protests have been legal for centuries, democrat lead parties, and unions have been doing it too, so blow this post up your backside. Remember what happened in Minneapolis, yeah that was way worse the January 6th. This post says it\u2019s wrong when it involves our gov, I say bs.\n\u56de\u590d @JaredRyanSears @JoeBiden One death yes, that was a former unarmed military lady who supported trump killed by capital police. So you can keep your insurrection argument, cuz it was a peaceful protest where democrat left out the full story. Now ur democrat blm riots that\u2019s a whole different story.\n\u56de\u590d @JoJoFromJerz Biden sure acts like one thow, Congress  does not vote in favor of student loan forgiveness, our justices vote it out, and Biden goes ahead and puts it threw anyway. Dictators do what they want, and so does Biden. So he is no different then trump.\n\u56de\u590d @MayoIsSpicyy That\u2019s why cops were the ones that drew the blood of unarmed citizen thow. Not the protesters that have the legal right to do so, but now democrats threw them in jail. But George Floyd riots caused much more damage and destruction but that\u2019s ok Right? Cuz they were democrats.\n\u56de\u590d @Jakeschills @beepx22 @Victorshi2020 Good then trump is looking pretty good yet even with Haley standing in the way yet.

I\u2019m on it, lol, NOT!!!\n\u56de\u590d @SenWarren Yep tax the rich as politicians become millionaires on 6 digit incomes.

Gov quit spending\n\u56de\u590d @harryjsisson Let see, if you have spend 9 years of being totally harassed and treated like total shit for doing nothing but wanting what\u2019s best for America, and the American Dream to go on.

Shame on American democrats, pathetic people.\n\u56de\u590d @Travis_in_Flint But we\u2019re all looking so forward to the Democrats Democracy of jailing cops for doing their jobs, and making drug addicts hero\u2019s. Burning down police stations, private businesses, and having political prisoners for a ralley that no one except protesters blood was shed.\n\u56de\u590d @JoeBiden Meanwhile throughout the country big powerful businesses are down sizing and cutting jobs, yep you gave us back some part time jobs but that\u2019s not helping middle class families so cut the bullshit and lies.\n\u56de\u590d @joncoopertweets Lmao that Mr cooper is in your head, I mean their is nothing wrong with democrats elites picking your next presidential candidate for ya, cuz the voters shouldn\u2019t be able to do that for themselves in primaries.

I\u2019m a Pittsburgh but you gotta get a driver, brother.\nAs American vets that shoot AR 15 explain to me how he gets a scratch and 138 yards away but the people that was shot and wars are badly wounded explained to me how Trump only gets a scratch, please\n\ud83c\udf89 thank you for fighting for your son Jordan and every child that has been killed from gun violence. Stay strong.\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83d\udc99\nWhy not ask the question that everybody thinks about how many reporters aids of the court and court officers have fell asleep this morning?\nCall Katie Tur was on Donald Trump\u2019s team. You could tell the way she reports so far about his misdeeds. We won\u2019t even talk about Hagerman.\nBetween the court system and the media, the television media I\u2019m very disappointed in the adults in this country that want you to support the military and support politicians, but they don\u2019t support the people\nRepublicans are so desperate to make the difference between their felon president and a good and decent man called Joe Biden\nNo Margot, that is the rule of the law and he\u2019s doing his job. Thank you Marc\u2764\ufe0f\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83d\udc99\nMaybe it\u2019s less a hope that should go home. His ability to interview seems for short of his ability to ask normal questions.\nI love you, Michael, but if the Dems would listen to you, we wouldn\u2019t run eight straight faces come on brother you speak through the power keep on speaking the truth. The truth is three Republicans have one state races, but not big ones.\nHe\u2019s tired from playing eight rounds of golf instead of calling the widow of the man that was shot", "overlap_score": 0.1209156342999284, "MARITAL": "Never married", "AREA": "Cities", "INCOME": "Middle Income", "RACE": "Black Alone", "EMPLOYMENT": "Working now", "RELIGIOUS": "Christianity", "PARTY": "Republican Party", "AGE": "Elderly (over 65 years old)", "IDEOLOGY": "Liberal", "GENDER": "Male"}, {"user_id": 1293815457842159616, "screen_name": "nostalgicbbv", "user_at_name": "Best of Vanessa Hudgens \u2606", "sample_content": "June 14, 2021: Vanessa Hudgens via Alisa Rauner's instagram story. https://t.co/wIgF1j20cB\nMay 9, 2020: Vanessa Hudgens via her instagram story. https://t.co/hrlJlUUoyp\nFebruary 25, 2009: Vanessa Hudgens shopping in Los Angeles. https://t.co/A9r79iKvfr\nJune 3, 2021: Vanessa Hudgens at the park in Los Angeles. https://t.co/tlsLTzwbQH\nAugust 30, 2023: Vanessa Hudgens via her instagram story. https://t.co/5L9d0kpq9a\nJuly 27, 2010: Vanessa Hudgens out in West Hollywood. https://t.co/S3lVNN1yhG\nJuly 22, 2019: Vanessa Hudgens attends the \"Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood\" Premiere in Los Angeles. https://t.co/NCDwGRNDQO\nJune 25, 2008: Vanessa Hudgens is interviewed while on the set of \u201cHigh School Musical 3\u201d in Salt Lake City, Utah. https://t.co/O7TBoXAAha\nMay 21, 2021: Vanessa Hudgens reveals her favorite memory from Knott's Berry Farm. https://t.co/qBHBMRAo3Q\nMay 20, 2021: Vanessa Hudgens via Max Clayton's instagram. https://t.co/l2ZALGlMn1\nJune 4, 2022: Vanessa Hudgens attends Sarah Hyland's Bridal Shower in Los Angeles. https://t.co/pLqp7542RE\nJuly 15, 2011: Vanessa Hudgens on the set of \"Gimme Shelter\" in Newark, New Jersey. https://t.co/N10Zav0Wrh\nJanuary 26, 2022: Vanessa Hudgens via Chad Wood's instagram story. https://t.co/EPCHjNVMn9\nMay 29, 2010: Vanessa Hudgens at Stella's middle school graduation in Los Angeles. https://t.co/mVgNCih0yQ\nMay 15, 2017: Vanessa Hudgens leaving Alfred {Coffee + Kitchen} in Melrose Place. https://t.co/Ms1qAkdyJ6\nAugust 24, 2008: Vanessa Hudgens performing at the Rodgers Amphitheater in Vancouver, Canada during the Identified Summer Tour. https://t.co/0nAF0QJ0SI\nApril 3, 2022: Vanessa Hudgens at a benefit for The BASE at the Garfield Park Conservatory in Chicago, Illinois. https://t.co/SUlN6WVqBn\nJanuary 13, 2022: Vanessa Hudgens via instagram. https://t.co/HeS42CpA4e\nJuly 23, 2019: Vanessa Hudgens and Rumer Willis attend the \"Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood\" Charity Dinner Hosted by RAD &amp; Levi's in West Hollywood. https://t.co/eTgozOeWnX\nJune 2, 2010: Vanessa Hudgens leaving a friend's house in Woodland Hills. https://t.co/2D33o3OjHL\nJune 12, 2010: Vanessa Hudgens on the set of The Beach Girl5's \"Scratch\" music video in Los Angeles. https://t.co/JnmN1OtTdK\nJune 7, 2018: Vanessa Hudgens via her instagram story.  https://t.co/7N3nroVtHV\nJuly 23, 2006: Vanessa Hudgens and Ashley Tisdale attend the 22nd Television Critics Association Awards in Pasadena, California.       \"High School Musical\" received the award for Outstanding Achievement in Children's Programming. https://t.co/fwLoBYTRkm\nAugust 7, 2011: Vanessa Hudgens backstage of \"Hairspray\" at the Hollywood Bowl. https://t.co/GU9w0nKW5T\nApril 26, 2015: Vanessa Hudgens leaving her apartment in New York. https://t.co/5tlb3AsEee\nApril 23, 2018: Vanessa Hudgens via instagram. https://t.co/XZHtXrAfTg\nJanuary 22, 2019: Vanessa Hudgens via her instagram story. https://t.co/AKGjAAXqCy\nJuly 27, 2022: Vanessa Hudgens at the Forte dei Marmi Beach in Tuscany, Italy. https://t.co/8AubLnjanh\nJune 1, 2015: Vanessa Hudgens attends the CFDA Fashion Awards at Lincoln Center in New York. https://t.co/444f1xKMJu\nAugust 20, 2009: Vanessa Hudgens shopping in Vancouver, Canada with Ashley Greene. https://t.co/KlXRtrZe1Q", "overlap_score": 0.2284699528253281, "MARITAL": "Never married", "AREA": "Cities", "INCOME": "High Income", "RACE": "White Alone", "EMPLOYMENT": "Working now", "RELIGIOUS": "No religion", "PARTY": "Democratic Party", "AGE": "Youth (18-35 years old)", "IDEOLOGY": "Moderate", "GENDER": "Female"}, {"user_id": 1382427167519346690, "screen_name": "BrotegeM", "user_at_name": "BROTEGE", "sample_content": "\u56de\u590d @gunsnrosesgirl3 Living in the Suburbs.\n\u56de\u590d @AfricanArchives I don't know why you would call \"Tusla\" a massacure\".

It's too old and too late. The state should not be mandating what grown adults do with their time.  Put it in the national curriculum or as part of a further education qualification.\n\"when people are doing no harm, government should leave them to work through their own virtues and vices in voluntary association with other people.\"  Quite.

We're not producing enough kids, so we need to balance our age demographic through immigration. Clearly going over the top in recent years and needs to stop.\nExactly. The state shouldn't, in times of peace, be mandating what fully grown adults do with their time.  The values they are trying to instil are positive but they should be instilled at a younger age. Either in the national curriculum or a further education qualification.\n\u56de\u590d @CommonsSpeaker needs to provide details of the threats that he heard, urgently.

We thank God for this family with them at the top of the\nWe\u2019ll vote for the party that instigates investigations into our illegal banks. Santander being the biggest and most fraudulent of these banks. The FCA need to change their legislation on how these banks are managed. They and the FOS need to be definitely independent\nWatching the news this morning &amp; hearing the sad news on the passing of the great Rob Burrows. Surely this will teach Ms Rantzen a lesson or three here was a young man with everything to live for &amp; had it stolen from him at such a young age he still fought on. He is to be admired\n\u56de\u590d big mistakes, so with the errors made by them  we the Client were made to pay and suffer. We need an Investigative Reporter to look into this Bank but it would appear these Reporters are afraid of the Bank.  See my contract tell me where this states Interest only https://t.co/24KLn4ZgEL\nHappy Birthday Prince George, have a great day May your family stay fit and healthy. We need all of you\nI doubt the word \u201crefugees,\u201d I go more for escapees\nYou see below copy of an agreement made in 1989 the contract was 20 years why then in 2024 do Santander say it\u2019s still unsettled ? You work hard pay your bills then your mortgage lender makes a mistake refuses to accept it and you suffer. Do you agree this is WRONG? https://t.co/FNpckBLXTn\nSave the first \u00a3100 million of FCA bank fines for hospices. - Sign the Petition! https://t.co/v31yc563wb via @UKChange\n\u56de\u590d Where are the words Interest Only written? How does a 20 year Mortgage Repayment be unsettled 34 years late? Honest answer Santander\u2019s lies\nMy God daughter works for Border Force &amp; she says on a sunny clear day up to 400 small boats come across the channel what are the French doing to stop this, we do after all pay them millions every year to protect us.\nI do hope you are taking me seriously when I advise you that Bank Santander. A Bank that\u2019s happy to invent an arrears &amp; to break the law set down by the FCA is one that cannot be trusted. Added to which they give their banking clients even bigger problems as at present. Not good https://t.co/jjnt01Tuqg\nWe truly do not give our animal friends the true honour and love that they deserve\nI do so worry about justice in Engkk my and now. Take Santander- well I wish someone would. How can they get away with bullying &amp; threatening us at 80 yrs old, saying we owe an \u00a375k from 1990 a Repayment. the FOS say it can't be investigated because its out of time definition\nOne thing Santander\u2019s Executive Communications is very good at, is lying. Take Georgina Nelson in an effort to cover the mistake made by Santander she contacted our daughter how? Or why? Told her our first loan was Interest Only you can see it\u2019s a lie then told her if we didn\u2019t\nHere is positive proof that Santander  are fraudulent corrupt bullies they make mistakes we suffer. Banks are supposed to have a Duty of Care to their Clients. Santander have none. To be a Bank an institution has to comply with certain rules or they lose their licence. They don\u2019t https://t.co/Ecip6vdu6Z\nGod knows better what we can achieve to help others. Glad you made it\nI object to this, they will now be fed cared for medical care dentistry and more. Hanging or a lethal injection then the matter\u2019s sorted\n\u56de\u590d @alanvibe Why do Islamics want to run from their countries to a Christian Western Society? Afraid of living in and among their own people? Shame on them\n\u56de\u590d for you. Then no hospital appts because immigrants have them all. NHS overcrowded underfunded because the new comers haven\u2019t  never will pay a penny towards it. How long before Starmer implements Sharia law then you\u2019ll really be stuffed. Oh yes the Labour Party has done well not\nThe Islamic Faith leads everything &amp; everyone to cruelty. Don\u2019t like this food anyway, last time we had a portion about 20 years ago my husband and I had food poisoning. Don\u2019t recommend KFC to anyone\nWe never eat their rubbish food, only ate it once 30 years ago and we both had food poisoning\nCrumbs a lot of expensive surgery pity it didn\u2019t make her a nicer person. Watching the body langusge she obviously can\u2019t bear to be touched by him, if you rent yourself by the day you have to suffer what you get, enjoy.\nAfrica wanted independence of us from UK France Portugal &amp; other countries they have their independence send the back to where they come from\nNo one can disagree with this. He\u2019s invited his family and friends to help destroy what even Hitler couldn\u2019t. And he\u2019s done it from the ground up with help From people our NHS cares for, schools educate the destruction of our Free Christian ways &amp; we pay the Bastard to do this\nWhen we retired we expected to be able to relax and enjoy our lives, then the ugly face of Santander Bank reared its ugly head, as you will see a 20 yr Mortgage paid up in 2010 according to them it suddenly became Interest Only, as has been proven in  1989 Santander made\nYou been watching the Channel 4 interview shame on you. Yell me someone who wouldn\u2019t like for personal gain, I bet you would!!!\nWell let\u2019s face it he opened the streets up for the family to come and destroy our streets so why not just build for them only, the East End of London already looks like Baghdad\nTake it from one who knows you cannot trust your home &amp; your life  to Bank Santander. They employ people like Nelson &amp; Ovington who will happily defraud you. Alter figures to suit Santander, &amp; a CEO who doesn\u2019t go to his office? I\u2019ve never heard the like of that before!\nyou will see the loan taken out in 1989 was 20 yrs. in 2007 the sum owing was \u00a32,334.01 the \u00a340,800 has also been cleared but the figure in the middle is positive proof that Santander will can fraudulently alter figures to put you in debt you don\u2019t owe.
