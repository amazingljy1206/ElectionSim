They lie a lot and have too many lawsuits to be taken seriously. Pleasure and pain can exist in safe and consensual settings. Sex and violence can not. The two are not the same. Pornhub is sexual violence\n\u56de\u590d @fujostarion Especially when it comes to male gaze vs. female gaze and consent. Porn desensitizes men and young boys to believe that what girls/women \"want\" or \"respect\"/respond to the best is violence/coercion. And pushes inc*st, cp, etc. They also ignore any acknowledgment toward consent.\n\u56de\u590d @PaulyToad25 Thank you. I've been saving it for the perfect conversation.

When kids are actually educated on it, they are more likely to speak up.\n\u56de\u590d @_nomadic_soul Men don't want to understand. They believe that women are just being emotional, and this is just based off of feeling but men have shown over and over why they should by responding violently. Wouldn't you say that's emotional?\n\u56de\u590d @robkhenderson Yeah I can tell this article didn't talk to actual women. Women  are not into that stuff the way that men think they are.

It's even more confusing when a child goes through it since they don't understand what's happening to their bodies and why it's reacting in that way.\n\u56de\u590d @_celia_bedelia_ Studies show that it literally takes on average 7 attempt to permanently get away from an abuser\n\u56de\u590d @Thaleresq @jakeshieldsajj I've been reading up on it lately and there is a pretty big reason he did, what he did.

Children are struggling and need proper sex Ed not porn. They need to learn consent from an early age, and they need limited access to internet\n\u56de\u590d @revelfemme Before feminism young boys didn't have many laws protecting them. They made it possible for there to be an age of consent for boys against adult men because there wasn't really any until the 90s do to the HIV/AIDs epidemic. Men also didn't want their son to be gay.\n\u56de\u590d @joeymama2121 @ubelfem True but even though they are barely legal...why do you think they have girls that already look underage infantilize themselves even farther.

BDSM is NOTHING like porn shows. That's the problem. Women don't like violence they like giving partial/total control in a comfortable and safe setting, not violence. Even fifty shades is a shitty depiction of that.\n\u56de\u590d @wheresurhusband @Cluffalo Yeah, that's also lacking social skills. That actually does more harm than good. If sex is the first thing to come to mind when you think of \"intimacy\" and social skills that's not good. Making out with drunk girls is to you can practice social skills sounds predatory\n\u56de\u590d @_nomadic_soul The question wasn't \"Would you rather be raped and murdered by a bear or a man?\" The question was,\"Would you rather be alone or come across a man or a bear in the woods.\" Men made up all the murder/rape scenarios and memes. That's why women chose the bear. You gave them examples\n\u56de\u590d @DoomScroling It's worst than what you think\n\u56de\u590d @HarrietCarried One 10 year old was raped by her deacon at 9. Her mom forced her to get married to the man who raped her who was in his 20s. She had 5/6 kids by the time she was 16 years old. One of the saddest stories I've heard.  Victims aren't old enough to divorce, so they're trapped  til 18\n\u56de\u590d @AZVotes Laws to protect boys from men are still pretty new.   It wasn't until the 60s feminist movement that they requested laws also protecting boys under 18 from being abused/sexual exploited. Conservative christians fought to keep it 16 (and still do).  They don't want to protect boys\n\u56de\u590d @FearedBuck Isn't that called Tantric sex. It's supposed to ground and connect the mind, body, and soul while releasing built-up sexual energy. It's supposed to be really useful for men, too, and could help them reach multiple orgasms\n\u56de\u590d @PaulyToad25 It's honestly just the start of grooming. That's how they \"test the waters\" to see if the child's the perfect victims.  The more the victims tolerate and try to brush it off as nothing, the harder they push and the worse it gets, especially if they think they won't get caught.\n\u56de\u590d @joeymama2121 @ubelfem The whole reason the teen category got taken down was because they were getting caught up.
