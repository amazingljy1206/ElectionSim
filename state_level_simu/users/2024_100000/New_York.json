Some of them make are making a lot of money.\n\u56de\u590d @TheGeneral_0 I know things are different post Covid. If you don\u2019t have Covid, you might have to tough it out. I am retired but when I worked, I hardly missed a day my entire working life, 40 years. Because I had a child there was no way I was going to get fired. I dragged myself to work.\n\u56de\u590d @TalbertSwan This was started by Joe Biden when he announced that he was going to pick a vice president that was a specific race and gender. He wasn\u2019t the only one that said that. Then he said it would be someone that would be qualified as well. Blame him.\n\u56de\u590d @Dentonandsas @mmpadellan Awful people.\n\u56de\u590d @ArtCandee @mmpadellan He added, that conclusion does not appear in my report. Why is it people have to watch hours of something to hear for themselves the truth while others just post half truths.\n\u56de\u590d @LqLana 2 party system no longer works. Eventually we have to have a third party. Why not now?\n\u56de\u590d @TheDiane0905 I don\u2019t think you should ask anyone who they\u2019re voting for so you can decide if you hate or like them.\n\u56de\u590d @DarrenB83616192 @TizzyEnt All people have to do is to not talk about these things, and those things don\u2019t exist to them. The media won\u2019t talk about these things either. Although I wouldn\u2019t have used the F word.

Fleet station has a two-level car park. The top deck is a flimsy-looking structure on top of the existing normal car park. This was around 2016. Wokingham station got a similar upper deck in 2017.

Very few people actually paid those high rates. These days the loopholes have gone (at least in the UK). We can expect high-earners to leave the country if they are taxed too much.\nFun fact: Britain was a multi-cultural society long before it was multi-racial. The class divide is cultural - just watch Keeping Up Appearances or even The Inbetweeners. It\u2019s hard to spot in other countries, but I don\u2019t think the rest of Europe divides class quite like we do.\nThe graph below shows two-year 85% LTV fixed-rate mortgage rates. Contrary to popular recollection (Mandela effect), rates on new loans didn\u2019t collapse to 0% in 2008. In fact they declined steadily until the late 2010s. That explains rising home-ownership amongst the young. https://t.co/2tmEAJljRj\nWhy does Spain have cheaper electricity than France, despite the latter having so much nuclear power? https://t.co/AHjCrQkt1R\n\u56de\u590d @type1ayy @s8mb @SpeakMouthWords A grand national purpose, like in Israel or during Covid, can boost innovation. Even the Soviet Union had a fair amount of innovation, based on the idealism of Communism + the Cold War footing. Not clear how you sustain that boost in a secular state during peacetime.\n\u56de\u590d @smnhmd It\u2019s historical navel-gazing nostalgia. The docklands as we know it today was complete by the 1990s: the DLR opened in 1987, and One Canada Square opened in 1991. Here we are a third of a century later, pretending that we can still build things.\n\u56de\u590d @Record_Factory I\u2019ve heard similar stories, yes. Does Manchester have other non-BBC big corporate employers, such that a married couple could relocate there easily? Or do media people all marry each other anyway, so it\u2019s moot?\n\u56de\u590d First of all, is it true? Yes!

It\u2019s nice for a day, maybe two; but after that they just want to get on with their lives. But the cultural pressure is to stay in bed.\n\u56de\u590d @realhansard More to the point, the ULEZ expansion will have been in place for nine months by the time the election takes place.

If anyone\u2019s made it more difficult for abuse victims/survivors, she has.\n\u56de\u590d @danwootton No one cares. This is a nothing story. Focus on the issues that are destroying our country and the people who live in it. Not this.\n\u56de\u590d @RedLeader2022 @glossyinferno It wasn\u2019t because she wasn\u2019t a full party\u2026 the law suit was against the sun. The judge took her word for it and she wasn\u2019t required to give half of the evidence she did in the US trial. Once she was required to give all the missing or redacted evidence not used in the uk trial\n\u56de\u590d @glossyinferno Afraid to report violence, to ask for help, and to get to safety. You will be believed you will be supported. Please don\u2019t let any of this make you doubt that. You are loved. You are not alone. No matter the gender. Violence is violence and it\u2019s abhorrent no matter what.\n\u56de\u590d @zaunither Saying that it\u2019s scaring victims from coming forward is doing far more damage. She is a woman who lies about abuse. I know that this fact goes against your narrative, that women cannot be abusers, but all genders are capable of abuse, all are capable of lying, of manipulation ..\n\u56de\u590d @HeardHeroine Amber heard was proved to have lied, repeatedly with malice. Please stop putting her on a pedestal, when it was determined she lied. It does a disservice to all survivors of all genders. Myself included. There was multiple audio proving she physically assaulted him.\n\u56de\u590d @GerryGently @glossyinferno \u2026 I am a survivor. I know people who are survivors. We lived it and I don\u2019t believe her. That\u2019s it and after speaking about the trial with fellow survivors of DV many of us came to the same conclusion. So no you don\u2019t speak for all of us. Many support JD too.\n\u56de\u590d @sanlangsbf But the verdict remains so nonetheless\u2026 and nothing is going to change what the jury decided, Nothing. And just because the verdict fits the \u2018what\u2019s perceived as unusual narrative\u2019 showing men can be abused by women, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s incorrect. They can. They are\n\u56de\u590d @deviouslez We care she lied about being a survivor of DV.  Funnily enough, it bothers all of us who have experienced DV, that someone who lied is being put on a pedestal because it diminishes our story and journeys and makes it a damn sight more difficult for any person going through DV.\n\u56de\u590d @tigerfly22 Drastically manipulated the trial based on her own behaviours was her. And AH team allowed her to do it. I have no doubts about the powers of SM\u2026 it\u2019s incredibly powerful. But again there is 0 evidence SM or anything external influenced any member of the jury.\n\u56de\u590d @BBCBreaking That\u2019s so sad. \ud83d\ude1e condolences and love to all his friends and family xx\n\u56de\u590d @RedLeader2022 @glossyinferno The holes in the whole narrative were exposed \u2026 and she was found to have lied.

I hope they are doing okay x\n\u56de\u590d @glossyinferno You are right many victims don\u2019t go to hospital when they undergo violence or assault\u2026 due to trauma.

Once the Tories slammed that window, it wasn\u2019t going to happen. Sadly Tories made that choice for us.

Citizens must be able to pay taxes, passport fees etc with ZiG.\n\"Let's use this Heroes Day not only as a time of remembrance but as a moment to recommit ourselves to the unfinished work of our heroes: the creation of a Zimbabwe where freedom, justice, and human dignity are a reality for every citizen.\" Our statement on #HeroesDay2024 https://t.co/L0a7YDgJcL\nIn our April 2024 policy brief, we called for an amendment of the Traditional Leaders Act to add a code of conduct to regulate the conduct of traditional leaders.  https://t.co/74VGEKsYll https://t.co/GQAeKNGaTw\nLast week we were in Chegutu, and the residents had one clear message to their local and central government :Come back to the people and deliver service! Heal Zimbabwe creates platforms of engagement between citizens and duty bearers. https://t.co/f1x1LdFuWa\nHeal Zimbabwe joins the motherland in celebrating #AfricaDay2024. We call for a peaceful resolution of the crisis in DRC and other conflicts together with an end to military coups across Africa. Africa must build stronger institutions and amplify citizen voices!!!! https://t.co/fVjK2SDQ5C\nHere at Heal Zimbabwe Trust, we believe firmly in community collaboration and solutions in resolving local conflict. Our community peace clubs have cemented their positions as leaders in conflict transformation and social accountability. #AsOne https://t.co/PHwPWOkI2x\nBreaking. In a sad ruling, a Harare Magistrate has denied Robson, Namatai and Samuel bail. We restate our call for their release. They are political prisoners. #FreePoliticalPrisoners\nCorruption weakens public institutions, eroding citizens trust and destroys the nation's moral fabric. Weak institutions breed inequality, conflict and instability. @ZECzim must take the nation into confidence on allegations of financial  impropriety raised. https://t.co/C2pwCp8nzO\n\u56de\u590d @crisiscoalition #StandUpForZimbabwe\nHuge victory in human rights protection @ZLHRLawyers Victims of human rights violations at the hands of the state deserve justice. Hopefully, the Independent Complaints Commission will ensure justice for more victims\nToday marks 9 years since the enforced disappearance of #ItaiDzamara. The government of Zimbabwe has ignored an order requiring them to report on progress made looking for Itai every two weeks. #JournalismIsNotACrime. #NoToEnforcedDisappearances https://t.co/5lYe7UYKM1\nThank you @ZLHRLawyers for standing with victims and survivors of state sponsored violence in their quest for justice. It is important that Parliament expedites the appointment of the Independent Complaints Commission to ensure access to justice for more victims\nThe scourge of state sponsored violence on defenseless citizens rears its ugly head again. Arrested and detained persons have a right dignity and freedom from torture and inhuman treatment. @PoliceZimbabwe must abide by Section 50 of the Constitution.\nOn this #DayOfTheAfricanChild #June16, we call on the @_AfricanUnion to protect children in conflict areas in line with @UN Security Council Resolutions 1261, 1314 and 1379. We also call for action towards the progressive realization of the rights of children. https://t.co/zmhBrct32f\n\u56de\u590d @HeraldZimbabwe Is the new currency now backed by the Police? https://t.co/lcBQ7PT0uk\nSAY THEIR NAMES! FORGET THEM NOT!  The incarcerated @CCCZimbabwe supporters are victims of politically motivated persecution by prosecution.

We call for a transparent process that is nonpartisan and caters for every vulnerable household without discrimination. The crisis we face demands that noone is left behind. https://t.co/XC0m9gFwQ5\n\u56de\u590d @HeraldZimbabwe @ZACConline must live up to its Constitutional obligations and reduce corruption. https://t.co/lehLdl30CG\nThe #Gukurahundi Community Meetings must satisfy the minimum standards set by the @_AfricanUnion Transitional Justice Policy in pursuit of a process anchored on the 5 pillars of Transitional Justice.

We reiterate our call for the @zhrc365 to investigate the systemic undermining of the rights of local communities. https://t.co/ur2pCtBTV6\n\u56de\u590d @zimlive State sponsored violence on defenseless citizens in police custody is fundamental violation of human rights. @PoliceZimbabwe must not tear the Constitution and throw human rights out of the window like these.\nCitizens must never live in fear. The crackdown on prodemocracy voices towards the @SADC_News Summit created a climate of fear. https://t.co/aV51evbL8t\n\u56de\u590d @Zinasuzim President Emmanuel Sitima will appear in court this morning. We call for his release and the release of all political prisoners unjustly incarcerated. #FreeSitima https://t.co/yzFIjDOCs6\nOur social cohesion dialogue meetings have become platforms of engagement between the citizen and local leaders providing an opportunity to discuss and resolve key issues in local communities. https://t.co/0Yk83ZC0eL\nThe bail ruling for the @CCCZimbabwe #Avondale78 activists has been moved to the 27th of June.

They won't be making any moves without consulting the fabled Ecclesiastical Insurance Group. What's abundantly clear: victims are regarded as a LIABILITY financially/reputationally.\n\u56de\u590d @SewellMartin Yes, and its also standard practice in the Church of England (and seemingly acceptable) for senior figures to come out with the most ridiculous lies when covering up or defending their misdemeanours or the behaviour of abusers they don't want taken out of circulation.\n\u56de\u590d @BonkyUncle75383 @BigRedBrexitBus @BenWalkerUKIP @DVATW I would say I'm a fan of David and his interview style etc, but I don't think mankinis come into it for me.

They are as guilt as the criminals. Defund and shut down these agencies.

Shameful.. demonstrates the weakness of the Republican leadership!\n\u56de\u590d @humaneventslive @JackPosobiec The Democrats have 6 years of experience in early voting.  Why? Simple.. the Republican leadership has been and continues to be weak and disorganized. Therefore, is drowning in self interest leadership.\n\u56de\u590d @JCats2013 @tedcruz Not a single person loss their job/fired.  One was forced to resign and most likely received a big severance!\n\u56de\u590d @RepStefanik @marklevinshow Ask your colleague, Johnson, the speaker.

Just sayin'.\n\u56de\u590d @1goodtern you know, this may be true. So, let's not talk about Covid, let's talk about this new illness. What should we do about that? Spreads pretty quick, can we prevent that? Hurts a lot of people, can we prevent that? What is their solution?  So, so cross.\n\u56de\u590d @JennyBirdresqr @watson_wear @DrJenGunter That makes perfect sense to me. But people who handle guns \"for a living\" are telling me that isn't responsible. So, I don't know how it will work out for Mr. Baldwin.\n\u56de\u590d @yashar @EllenBarkin HUZZAH!\n\u56de\u590d @JennyBirdresqr @watson_wear @DrJenGunter No, they don't. They are ex-military and have extensive training in teaching shooting and safety. My problem is that movie sets are not the military, right. So they developed their own standards that would provide safety in that environment. Possibly that will change now.\n\u56de\u590d @Billius27 @fordnation How on earth does @fordnation not see how egregious this is? I have to line up for hours to get a prescription renewed if I don't have a GP, but...good for me...I can buy alcohol from the corner store. And don't tell me they can multitask!!!

If we get enough polls, I'll switch to that.\n\u56de\u590d @katieporteroc Losing is never fun. But calling the election \"rigged\" is wrong. Your campaign was well-funded and got its message out.
