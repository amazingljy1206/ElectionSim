The Dems must have changed the definition of democracy too like they have everything else.\n\u56de\u590d @krassenstein @elonmusk @CommunityNotes His opponent has NOT been found to have raped anyone. They couldn\u2019t get rape because they had no evidence of rape. No date or year this rape would have occurred. In other words they made it up! Then changed laws to bring charges in NY. Like Nancy says, it was \u201c The wrap up smear.\n\u56de\u590d @SnowDuff69 @EileenLugo1 @LeoTheLion1964 Since the indoctrination it\u2019s now a lot higher. In teens it\u2019s approaching 20%. It absolutely affects me as I have to change in a locker room with biological men. I am a grown woman and when thinking about young girls in this position makes me sick to my stomach\n\u56de\u590d @coldiemom @MTGrepp @Just_Carrie_ There are only two states that actually have laws to prevent illegals from voting. This is Joe\u2019s plan! You are naive.\n\u56de\u590d @PhilWilson123 @CitizenFreePres Except there is proof, the mayors letter. It\u2019s in writhing and you still won\u2019t believe it. Who is the loser?\n\u56de\u590d @ChrisDJackson Completely the opposite!\n\u56de\u590d @GibbsKeith3 @CarolLago128065 @RocketmakerAL Okay genius, the prosecutor didn\u2019t announce the crime the jury was to consider until the end of the trial after the defense rested. So if you didn\u2019t follow it or have any clue the facts, don\u2019t be a keyboard warrior. Just sit this one out or maybe do some actual fact finding.\n\u56de\u590d @MrSnail2077 @therealCoinmon @krassenstein There it is, the Dems are always throwing fear in our faces. The fact that they over react about everything, is why nobody trusts them! We k own what a Trump presidency looks like and that is what we are voting for. We know what a Biden Presidency looks like and Kamala will loose\n\u56de\u590d @vineetee @adeptusjihadi @elonmusk No, Biden should shut down the border exactly the way that Trump did with no extra Bills no extra executive powers. And no money for other countries! Just the laws on the books, that Biden is refusing to enforce!\n\u56de\u590d @Tim_Walz @KamalaHarris Abortions are not Joy. Celebrating abortions at your conference does not bring Hope. Your party used to say they should be safe and rare. Boy has that changed!\n\u56de\u590d @EdKrassen Kamala and Joe lie directly all the time! Like saying grocery store are gauging. They went from 3% profit to 1% profit. The real issue is hyper inflation caused from the Inflation Act they passed, which essentially is the Green New Deal. And government overspending.\n\u56de\u590d @harryjsisson Except that is NOT Trumps plan. Dems secret weapon, tell a lie over and over again until it\u2019s believed. We are done believing those who let millions into our Country and make us pay for the damage!\n\u56de\u590d @Leeleeliberty11 @Ojeda4America Exactly, but they changed the definition of recession so they are ignoring it, telling everyone how wonderful our economy is.\n\u56de\u590d @gayprincezote @WhaleLandUtahni @Serena_Partrick @JamesCo52049561 @GovEvers Most people don\u2019t have issues with Trans people, they have existed forever. The problem comes with allowing biological men in women\u2019s spaces and sports. Duh, that is why it\u2019s such a hot topic today. It\u2019s wrong. If it wasn\u2019t we never would have passed Title9.\n\u56de\u590d @CarolLago128065 @RocketmakerAL As far as the crime, the jury was to choose door 1,2 or 3. Give me a break! There is nothing above board on this trial. Every respected lawyer on both sides has come out and set it!. Which is why it will be overturned in 10 minutes. Purely political!\n\u56de\u590d @JoJoFromJerz We have always monitored books for kids over the years. They must be age appropriate. This is not new. As far as YOUR body, it\u2019s meant for states to decide period. How about all of you go to your state capitol and work on legislation to allow for women to terminate for one offs.\n\u56de\u590d @krassenstein All of the free stuff she is promising is going to cost tax payers period! She believes in Equity not Equality so she has to give free stuff!\n\u56de\u590d @BobMishler @mmpadellan Trump had many border policies that stopped an invasion. Biden rescinded them immediately. We don\u2019t need a bill for the border with built in money that has nothing to do with the border. We just need Trumps policies in place again. Biden has the record for illegals crossing\n\u56de\u590d @malonespeaking A school gymnasium, hmm impressive. It\u2019s not sane to use a coup to push out the candidate that your party has been lying about for years. Your party is as dishonest as it gets. Worried about loosing power. You couldn\u2019t care less about the safety of this country.\n\u56de\u590d @rondaleroi @ashleighlondon @elonmusk I am sorry about your doctor. But I\u2019m afraid you hold too much faith in this vaccine. Don\u2019t listen to me, research for yourself. All of the information is on the CDC website. It is not safe for everyone and it is not effective. The WHO has come out and said this already.\n\u56de\u590d @JoJoFromJerz It was a riot, not an insurrection. Very small amount of the population was violent in a crowd that size. We now know the FBI had human assets that they go to great lengths to cover up!\n\u56de\u590d @hopefuloptimist @Michell33650674 Actually no, that\u2019s your future if Kamala wins. We know exactly what happens if MAGA wins. We lived it four years ago, it was much better than what we live today. Your side is fear mongering.\n\u56de\u590d @thejackhopkins Right, he has been fighting so hard that he has made several trips to America for  photo opps. Don\u2019t recall another President whose country was at war doing this.\ud83e\udd14\n\u56de\u590d @CarolLago128065 @FunkoPopNut @fateddissent @RocketmakerAL You will condone this at every turn, I see that. The defendant must know the felony they are charged with to form their defense. To drop it at the end after the defense has rested is unconstitutional. Many well respected attorneys on both sides are speaking out about this.\n\u56de\u590d @Ally_Sammarco While you\u2019re on this train, where was Kamala\u2019s father? He wasn\u2019t at the convention to support her.\ud83e\udd14\n\u56de\u590d @EdKrassen Because his border policies worked at securing the border. Biden immediately redacted his policies leaving our border open so he could have a crisis and get loads of money for Ukraine. Many of us have longer than a 5 second memory. Unlike your followers.\n\u56de\u590d @gayprincezote @WhaleLandUtahni @Serena_Partrick @JamesCo52049561 @GovEvers American is about individual rights being equal, not advantages or extra rights. Women need safe spaces period. There was no issue with Trans people until the left went completely off the cliff!\n\u56de\u590d @Michell33650674 Such a lie! He has 87,000 IRS agents coming in. Nope they are after middle class. All transactions of 600 or more. They have to pay for all the illegals that will cripple this Country!
