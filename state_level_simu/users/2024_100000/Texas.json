I am hoping not to get wet on our adventures later. https://t.co/IeJHX0hXj9\nWe are a bit subdued in the Pippa household. After our adventure yesterday we visited Charlie in a continued attempt to build a friendship, but instead I snapped at him when he got too close. We know progress isn\u2019t linear, but we are all a little disappointed https://t.co/7jRtY0bGwr\nToday we had an adventure Saturday to Auckland Castle and Deer Park. The castle was shut and we didn\u2019t see any deer but we still had fun! https://t.co/x9CnEEMyzj\nIt was a little bit frosty this morning so I think I will be spending most of the day snoozling on the sofa under a blanket. I deserve it after my big adventures yesterday anyway https://t.co/VZ5hdlIC3b\nSquirrel activity was high today, we saw a very chubby one wrestling with a stick before running off into the tree. I hope they don\u2019t learn to arm themselves or I might be in trouble! https://t.co/jZvOrzXvY9\nHappy Sausage Saturday! Here are an assortment from our holiday so far.  There are 2 Berners in the cottage next door and they bark a lot! Other than that I am settling into our home away from home https://t.co/p4tQ8t4wqA\nToday I thought I was going to have to step in to break up a duck fight but luckily they sorted it out before I got my paws wet! Other than that it was an uneventful walk https://t.co/Zi342sz44n\nHere are some Thursday boops on a cold but dry morning. We saw a little puppy but it was too far away for a sniff. https://t.co/qNoPzKzBJG\nIt was a mild and quiet day in the park this morning, with one exception! A Weimaraner came bounding across the field to come say hello, I was a little concerned but luckily she went back to her human when he called her. I was a big brave girl and got treatos https://t.co/ZaO31ZQuLV\nHappy Friday!  The park was mainly quiet this morning, but there were two labs playing with a ball near me. I wanted to join in but wasn\u2019t allowed! https://t.co/l6Hqr1blga\nHappy Sausage Saturday! It has been raining a lot here, so although it wasn\u2019t actively raining on our walk this morning, I think it was important to let the human know how I feel about sogginess in general. I think I made it clear that I am not a fan\u2026 https://t.co/ZoGbrYUXJP\nAnother dry day in the park today, although it did rain overnight. The ducks were being a little naughty but mainly in the pond area so I let it slide. I did get barked at by an older lady dog, but I didn\u2019t let it bother me https://t.co/Gftk8mj5zx\nHappy Sausage Saturday! We\u2019ve decided to have a quiet weekend so no adventure Saturday today. It\u2019s pretty wet and we\u2019re all quite tired. Plenty of sofa snuggles and treatos to come! https://t.co/kngWQPhVH2\nIt\u2019s a lovely morning so I made sure the humans were up and awake to enjoy it. The ducks were mainly behaving and no sign of squirrel activity today. The parakeets were out in force too. Now I am having a sunny snooze in the conservatory. First time this year! https://t.co/GQe0zzwgbq\nHappy #TongueOutTuesday  Today we have quite the selection! https://t.co/ZbRV9YfSei\n\u56de\u590d @VVoble @CancerDoggy Absolutely scurrilous behaviour from that cheeky rodent!\nFor today\u2019s Adventure Saturday we went to Slaley Forest. It\u2019s a walk we\u2019ve done before, but that\u2019s okay because it\u2019s so nice. I was able to be off lead pretty much the whole time and was super well behaved, coming back when called every time https://t.co/eZ0XipsyTB\nIt was a little chilly this morning but my thick coat kept me warm. I saw a lab playing with a ball and I complained to my human about the grave injustice that I did not also have a ball. She didn\u2019t seem to care! https://t.co/O1zHGbRaGE\nGood morning! We are still waiting for spring to properly spring, but I guess I can cope with a bit of grey weather as long as it\u2019s dry! https://t.co/YFNM4rQVpG\nPark was quiet this morning and the duck pond has returned to normal levels. I saw a cute fluffy puppy but was happy to admire from a distance. https://t.co/4PDwtRBsme\nToday we adventured around Derwent Walk Country Park and we saw some very big dogs (Tibetan Mastiffs and a Great Dane) so I was very well behaved. https://t.co/v8MJxCqVKI\nIt was a warm dry day in the park today. There is some spring cleaning and rejuvenating going on too which is exciting. We also played catch the treat, and the human was very proud of a lucky shot with her camera https://t.co/0tgYPnPwan\nToday I allowed the humans a bit of a lie in as part of their extra extra long weekend. We then went round the park and saw the ducks but no squirrels. We will mainly be resting today to prepare for the usual Adventure Saturday tomorrow https://t.co/m5fAzA2A3u\nToday\u2019s adventure took us up some Northumberland hills near Bardon Mill. We skirted Vindolanda because they don\u2019t let dogs in! We also saw a lime kiln. There were lots of sheeps and we got a little soggy but it has been a grand end to the extra extra long weekend https://t.co/6XbiqzoutI\nThe park was pretty quiet this morning, so I made sure I took my time having plenty of sniffs. We saw a couple of dogs playing and I kept my eye on them in case they got too rowdy then I got barked at by two little schnauzers but I was very brave and didn\u2019t react https://t.co/LnPS7xtNjG\nHappy #TongueOutTuesday  Today I was working on a curly swirly theme.  The park was busier than normal but everyone was well behaved. I nearly got another dog in trouble as they wanted to wander over to say hello so much they ignored their human! https://t.co/GpecitUuha\nI am back on my usual park patrol and the sun has got his hat on! We didn\u2019t detect any naughtiness and the parakeets weren\u2019t being too loud, so all is well. https://t.co/sKIc0VQmae\nAnother calm and dry morning walk. We saw the parakeets, but the photo doesn\u2019t show how amazingly green they are \ud83e\udd9c  Squirrel activity was high but they were sensibly keeping their distance. No rogue ducks to herd either. https://t.co/2IzHIwf8g5\nWe had a lovely sunny adventure Saturday to Fontburn Reservoir today. Luckily there was lots of shade as the sun was definitely out to play!

She'd do better as an independent.  Yes she is a  factor in the fight against tRump but politically she holds very conservative  ideology.  Idk if she'd be an asset or a liability  I do know I wouldn't trust her outside of the scope of the j6 hearings.\n\u56de\u590d @Monstermash042 There's not much to argue about. Some things are great when using practical effects others are better served with cgi.  It all depends on the talent of the fx department.\n\u56de\u590d @IkklesaTwit My oldest son was a product of his voice... well him and Barry white and vandross\n\u56de\u590d @Lightenerrthang I'd prefer them seeing each other, staring in shock for a moment and then them running to each other.\n\u56de\u590d @AngryBlackLady I've been a  black belt for 11 years, train 3-4 days a week. Teach classes. Even with all that idk if I could hit that small of a target\n\u56de\u590d @valhallapics There's so many of them to choose from and I've seen a lot of great ones already posted. I'll pick this one, the first time my girl saved the group at the cdc https://t.co/VtF5mYnB1M\n\u56de\u590d @Lightenerrthang You're having a good time though right? Good news about the lack of blisters and no trouble with old injuries!\n\u56de\u590d @RyanMarino I was learning to  sew masks for nurse friends so they could wash the ones they had already worn. I also learned to make gowns and bought gloves whenever I could to send them to the lower 48.  I lost 4 family members in 4 months to covid. Of the 4, 3 believed it was a hoax.\n\u56de\u590d @DeschanelGold She's comfortable in her own skin and it shows.\n\u56de\u590d @DeschanelGold There were brief points when s8 could have been saved but alas we got that mess.\n\u56de\u590d @kate_mccrea @deniselynne1966 They're both bad ass survivors and neither deserves the hate they get.\n\u56de\u590d @WalkingDead_AMC Still the queen.\nHey @SkymiiboTWD  I finally got to see #GodzillaMinusOne  Solid entry into the franchise and reminded me of the earliest Godzilla movies. 9.5/10  I'll probably enjoy it even more on a rewatch.\n\u56de\u590d @Lightenerrthang Well SOMEONE has to promote it!  Fans have been doing the heavy lifting for a while now.\n\u56de\u590d @BenClaimed Their night is my late morning early afternoon!\n\u56de\u590d @Acyn As someone who spent 17 years paying off medical debt (as of may 2024 i am now medical debt free!!!)I approve!\n\u56de\u590d @Lightenerrthang I don't get why they are so triggered by a person they will never meet shipping 2 fictional characters on a basic cable station.  In what way does something harmless that brings you joy, devastate their lives to the point they got to harass you because you ship them\n\u56de\u590d @Livefreak01 Sabbath Korn  Floyd Ratm Chemical brothers\n\u56de\u590d @AngryBlackLady Yeah, don't say that where my mom and aunties could hear it. He was right up there with Burton Reynolds,  Cary grant,  Tom S, Elvis ect.\n\u56de\u590d @StarTrekFan79 Shes one of the main characters I'm torn on.  At the time (and even now at times) I find her abrasive.  BUT she had excellent character development and I ended up liking her for the most part. She was willing to learn and I appreciate that\n\u56de\u590d @SkymiiboTWD @Variety As companies are moving away from physical media I will miss out on movies in the future. It on me because the cost of streaming services rack up to being as expensive as cable once was. (Adjusted for inflation) good thing I've got several thousand dvd/blu-ray at home.\n\u56de\u590d @mmpadellan Love the alien movies! Ripley is the \ud83d\udc10\n\u56de\u590d @3kingvisions Frog and toad are friends.  My earliest memory is my grandfather reading it to me\n\u56de\u590d @KC_Democracy I missed Alaska.  Could someone tell me what song they used?\n\u56de\u590d @DannyDeraney You can still but them at the store. My grandkids love playing it\n\u56de\u590d @MentallyDivine Excellent break down. Especially the part about our anger masking our fear and sadness.  I'm terrified of what could happen to my kids, grandkids,  elders, neighbors,  and community members  if  tRump gets back in office.

My theory was that Trumps big thing was to get American access to Rusia's oil fields and then break OPECs back and make himself wildly rich in the process. All of these Soviet loving types also seem to be big Saudi suckups and downplay 9/11.\nIs it weird how the ctlead guy who is constantly screaming for a couple of hundred million dollars in state funding for a charter school is also a Republican gun nut anti police reform pos? https://t.co/tzFuPnK1Jb\n\u56de\u590d @GovNedLamont We know we're shoving tons of lead in your water and doing basically nothing about crime, pollution, and noise but look over there, a park!

They mean all of it, attic, rafters.. not just a reshingle. Hurricane damage. A lot of those clay tile roofs are not cheap either.\nI'd love to know the circumstances that landed this poor girl's word tour in Danbury fn Connecticut. Ticketmaster can't even tell you the venue beyond GA bleachers, GA field. And Capitol One city park lol. Only 235.00 a spot. https://t.co/a2e7NAgFfu\n\u56de\u590d @LibertyCappy That woukd almost cover the medical.plan.\nSelf driving cars are real, but global warming is a scam.\nBoy, if you thought your priest blowing the choir boys was bad, get a load of this fucking guy. Biden's next official act should be to seize Florida.. for the safety of all concerned.\n\u56de\u590d @aravosis The fun is gone out of the rallies just like his marriage.\n\u56de\u590d @VicNobu I vote for Derek Jeter every year cause he had that cool telescope in his apartment. Astronaut.\nThat's for sure. There won't be any Range Rovers lined up outside the new \"Career Academy\" for drop off and pick up.\nOf all the southern dishes we could have brought up here, Connecticut decided that the chicken sandwich was the way to go.\n\u56de\u590d @blm860 I think what I meant is she spoke plain language where normally this type of stuff is more subtle. This is like the bathroom conversation in Trading places. Whatever, I'd be interested in a transcript as well.\n\u56de\u590d @VicNobu @Tinoladobo @libsoftiktok When my company bought a bunch of .com failures  the code was always interestingly ameturish. Six months of Bangladeshi Java school does not an elegant solution make. Hard to tell if it's real. It doesn't look real simply because I have seen all sorts of randos use the n word.\n\u56de\u590d @ctlibertyjunky @gunpolicy @Tactical_review @BadWeaponTakes Yeah, but unlike you, I'm not simping for it.\n\u56de\u590d @MattLesser @SenBlumenthal @AmyMorrinBello Lol.. okee..  Nothing says violent urban crime quite like living on an exit ramp. https://t.co/bVU2EmlHrT\nThis will wipe out dozens of airports, which would be a self righting mechanism except we will immediately begin building new airports.\n\u56de\u590d @UpinCT @TownOfBethel_CT @BrookfieldRTC I have, the whole state is a disaster. Although.. I do appreciate that the new Federal road through Brookfield is no longer a raceway. You have to drive all the way down to Danbury before you can let her rip.\nROTFLOL.. Baptized in the same place she lost her virginity... to her Dad, probably.  America never fails to disappoint.\n\u56de\u590d @NewsTimes You can't just dump folks into towns that don't have a commercial tax base unless you defund the police and defend public schools. A household isn't productive enough to support itself and requires huge subsidies. Even middle income by Fairfield county standards.\nThis is so sad. We lost all the owls here in Danbury's west end. Trashed the wetlands, polluted the saugatuk, and for what, a few dozen more drive till you qualify homes for New Yorkers.\n\u56de\u590d @IreneO70144262 @ctnewsjunkie That's not the pledge of allegiance. Their all just hoping their hearts will settle down after seeing a Spanish speaking dude in the parking lot.\nThis is fun. I remember asking about all the borrowing Malarkey Mark had to do.. like fucking trained seals they all voted for the spending. And now this. Oh well. Just another flailing Connecticut town.\nSo we went from limes, 3 for 69 cents to 69 cents each. I'm going to just drink neat from now on.\nMy Great grandmother dies at 28 giving birth to her eight child.   Her headstone doesn't even have her name on it, just loving wife of her husband, and Hitler fanatic Johann.  MAGA..\n\u56de\u590d @CTSenateDems His defense was basically that everybody does it.

Instead we have made it into a feel good country club.\nWhen you\u2019re in sync with God, right doors will open as the wrong ones start to close.\nYou are free to think thoughts of worry or joy, and whatever you choose will attract the same kind back to you.\nThe ability to rejoice in any situation is a sign of spiritual maturity.\nProsperity doesn\u2019t answer to fasting and prayers, If you are not a giver you cannot be empowered to prosper.\nNothing on the planet is more powerful than the Word of God.\n\u2018It is better to be silent and thought a fool, than to speak and remove all doubt!\u2019 \u2014  Abraham Lincoln.\nDo you really want to get God\u2019s attention?

No one mentions them and they are all around the world promoting the US agenda and stirring chaos.\n\u56de\u590d @StefanBrakus93 This doesn't surprise me and supports the theory that many Nazis remained after World War II...This conflict has shown much evidence of their existence in Europe and the Americas...\n\u56de\u590d @DemostenesLock @ldpsincomplejos Son acaso responsables las mujeres y los ni\u00f1os sin contar hombres inocentes que deben haber?

The same happened to the Germans in 1945.\n\u56de\u590d @EP_President Delivered our taxpayers' money to the most corrupt country in Europe. The war is lost and the Ukrainian state is falling apart. Americans have stopped the funding but we continue against our interests! Will these funds ever be audited? How many commissions will be paid?\n\u56de\u590d @guyverhofstadt @leonidvolkov What about an investigation or you designate the guilty ones before having any evidence? I remind you that this was the modus operandi of totalitarian regimes. Are we slipping into a totalitarian regime? No rule of law anymore?\n\u56de\u590d @DD_Geopolitics @small_hat1 @elonmusk Maybe they need X to be free till the elections to get Trump elected and then they will enforce censorship. Zionist are on both sides of the equation anyways. Having as many alternative platforms as possible is the way in my opinion...\n\u56de\u590d @carlbildt Like the EU and the US will eventually. Just look how rigged the US election was \ud83d\ude02 The more US and EU attack Russians the stronger their resolve and rally around their leaders will be. It shows our level of hubris and ignorance on the nature and history of our \"alter egos\"...\n\u56de\u590d @Sprinter99800 Saber rattling by a negligible European country. They don't miss an opportunity to be loud, do not defend their population and their national interest and just play someone else's game. That's what a vassal state sounds like. In a conflict they will be the first to go... Fools\n\u56de\u590d @vicktop55 If they concentrate their vehicles in columns in this fashion they will not last long against an air strike... You can see that this is an exercise and not a realistic scenario. If it would be realistic forces they would be spread out.\n\u56de\u590d @vonderleyen @POTUS Do you ever contradict your masters?

No fue casualidad que acabar\u00e1 en Waterloo...\n\u56de\u590d @marianpy1 @guerrasygeo Those are the first to run away when they hear an explosion \ud83d\udca5 So far it's only a bunch of big mouths that run for the bunker.

Most of the conflicts you show where Russia was involved were instigated by the US and its special services. Chechnya through CIA and radical Islamists, equiping and training Georgian army &amp; supporting attack on Tsinkhvali, Proxy Ukraine.\n\u56de\u590d @HEISENBER123 @DemostenesLock @ldpsincomplejos Un Estado tiene m\u00e1s obligaciones que una organizaci\u00f3n terrorista y m\u00e1s si se vende como democr\u00e1tico.

Know your place in the grand scheme of things.\n\u56de\u590d @RealScottRitter Could it be a disinformation campaign aimed at cultivating the illusion of Israeli deterrence after the ridiculous Israeli response in Iran? A US attempt to dissuade Israel to escalate? The US badly needs to dissociate from Israeli actions before the elections...\n\u56de\u590d @Kanthan2030 @elonmusk US never does anything for free. There is always a financial or power projection interest behind.

Maximum 3pts out the next 3 games.   Then we\u2019ll go and beat Utd at OT.\nMy only concern with Sterling is his defensive contribution. Can we trust him to give us the same as Martinelli/Saka/Jesus/Trossard as a wide man in our 4-4-2 block? Not sure.  Everything else though, top.   Would take on a cut price, 100%.\nChampionship from March onwards is cinema. Every team playing for something, different styles going head to head. So much talent too, PL clubs need to shop there more often.\nBoth will get a shot in the first half of next season. Must perform well enough to break into the inner circle Arteta forms for the run ins.   Trossard did it.   Eddie played himself out of it with sub par performances.  These two had injury issues.  Next ssn = make or break.\nGibbs White is okay, good in transition. Ability to play on the half turn and ride contact. Lack of power and average ball-striking makes him a \u00a335m player or so. His ceiling is probably Brighton / Villa / Newcastle.   Nothing special.\n\u56de\u590d @r1medi And they look up to see 36yo Adam Lallana (part time coach)\u2026. while star attackers sit on the bench.\nMartinelli to become the versatile bench forward with Jesus on the way out? Seems pretty likely.   RW performance was good, held width well and kept the ball. Arteta needs to put him on the Sane regime. Saw a glimpse of it at 0:12.\nThis knocked his confidence even more.

Carlo letting the front 3 play with freedom. They were too much for Kimmich/Sane/Laimer/MdL out wide. Especially Vini.   As Pep said, tactics do not matter in the final third. It is talent.\nWhat can we learn from 23/24...  - peaking late is not enough to beat City. It worked pre-Pep but not vs these robots...  - City have lost one title, Liverpool were flawless until February. Based on evidence that's the only way we win it.  - Strong start is imperative for 24/25.\nTakes a lot of the physical burden off Rice, can play in all phases, Spanish MF so automatically a green flag technically, gets goals. Jack of all trades, I like.   Would\u2019ve liked a slightly lower fee, but all in all, good signing.\nCalafiori is a top acquisition. A fresh new \ud83d\udd11 to help unlock blocks and specifically help with our LHS issues. Truly a unique defender who makes most of his impact in the final third.  All while having a brilliant frame and the ability to defend wide.   Big fan of the deal.\nIn possession he improves us massively. Can pass into space and destroy low blocks. Also way less error prone than Partey in the first phase.   OOP I have worries but the value he would bring to us IP is worth the downside.   Sign him and Onana and our MF is set for years.\nPlayers have dropped off, Tuchel furious. Madrid settled into the game now, will be tough for Bayern. Had to get a goal in that early spell.\nPorto organised well, very compact block and little spaces btl. Unfamiliar dynamics in the back 3 has made for some shaky moments, Saliba as a WCB and Gabriel as the CCB is having its first real test. Not doing so well. Rice on a yellow has hindered him too.\nCroatia compact 442 block with the wingers defending deep. Basically the same system every top team plays OOP. Better than the dross we saw from Scotland yesterday.  Notice how quick Kova/Brozovic are onto Pedri too. He can win Spain the match today and Croatia know it.\nAit Nouri the Algerian Cancelo.

But when we specifically look at the issue of mass migration I think we should look at why this happens.\n\u56de\u590d @AngelEyeCrypto @donaldbloompf @DanielvsBabylon It\u2019s not biblically sound at all. \u201cThe foreigner residing among you must be treated as your native-born. Love them as yourself, for you were foreigners in Egypt. I am the LORD your God.\u201d (Leviticus 19:34)\n\u56de\u590d @Simple_Disciple I know He loves me because he has shown me. I got a hug from God and he gave me the Holy Spirit. I felt so loved and all of a sudden I loved other people (even the ones I did not like) too. That was not by myself, it was Gods love for everyone\n\u56de\u590d @TheMAGAConser88 @GuylolMrman @s1rlym @GarbageHuman23 Then explain acts 17:26. It says ALL the nations throughout the WHOLE world. It does not say only the white countries\n\u56de\u590d @catholicpat Bible verse?\n\u56de\u590d @local16653909 @farmingandJesus Treating people different based on their race. Yes we\u2019re all different but we\u2019re one in Christ and we walk in the Spirit and not in the flesh. It\u2019s wrong to put so much emphasis on race. It\u2019s about religion, not about race.\n\u56de\u590d @faithwillsaveu I love you Jesus. These are the words I said before the Holy Spirit came\n\u56de\u590d @JMurchadha @sovereignbrah All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness (2 Timothy 3:16). God clearly taught us to love foreigners as ourselves and treat them as natives.\n\u56de\u590d @son_of_zeal @Catholic_Jess \u201cFaith\u201d but are not an improved version of themselves and don\u2019t show good deeds, should ask themselves if they\u2019re really saved. The Holy Spirit makes you become a better person\n\u56de\u590d @rosarywmd @sweezy142813 Position the Catholic Church thinks she has, Jesus could have made his point here and uplift Mary. Instead, he downplayed the tendency to elevate Mary\n\u56de\u590d @Simple_Disciple Ultimately Jesus himself, I have a feeling he was showing me the way for a long time. But when I saw evil in the world and in myself I couldn\u2019t handle it anymore and that\u2019s when I asked Jesus for help\n\u56de\u590d @underground2099 @NoelleFitchett That just means that a woman\u2019s role (if she is married) is to be a good mother. But both men and women are saved through faith in Jesus\n\u56de\u590d @falthman71 @autocorrect2_0 I will show you my faith by my deeds (James 2:18). It\u2019s true that you shouldn\u2019t work your way into heaven because you\u2019re saved by the grace of God, but your good fruits show that you\u2019re saved\n\u56de\u590d @PvanHouwelingen Mijn opa heeft na de talloze pfizer injecties opeens last van z\u2019n hart en mijn neef heeft nu de ziekte van crohn (autoimmuunziekte).

They got demonic attacks from it. So it\u2019s not true that you have to give \u201cpermission\u201d for it to be demon worship\n\u56de\u590d @Simple_Disciple Calvary chapel Ontario on YouTube (pastor Paul LeBoutillier). He goes through the whole Bible as well and I think he\u2019s funny too which makes it fun to listen to\n\u56de\u590d @SentinelSam1 @autocorrect2_0 I don\u2019t understand your interpretation. Lazy people can still become very loving towards other people when they put their faith in Jesus. Love is what it\u2019s all about and this counts as \u201cworks\u201d\n\u56de\u590d @HonoredGroyper @PercyGroyper @NotBlindfolded I think every human being counts as neighbour. Jesus said that we should even love our enemies because we have to be special. Unbelievers only love people that are good to them. We should be good to everyone and love them. It\u2019s against our nature but we should walk in Gods spirit\n\u56de\u590d @ImBenOutis @UltraDane Did I ever say I\u2019m tolerant of crime? And I see the problems in different communities but I don\u2019t understand how hate, anger, or pride could fix this? Strict immigration policies and law enforcement is where the solution lies, and Christianity too, could fix a lot of degeneracy\n\u56de\u590d @Kyle64243163 @DonnieDarkened Satan uses things of God and creates a counterfeit perverted version. For example magic instead of miracles. Christ consciousness instead of mind of Christ. Manifesting instead of praying. I think the number 33 is used for perverse reasons as well by masons.\n\u56de\u590d @TheCanadianDav1 @steinbergreborn @JillColtonFree We\u2019re not racist or hateful. I hope people in the west return to Christianity so that God may save us from temptation.

You should see all the people crying because their kids died from fentanyl coming across the border, the elderly who can\u2019t pay their bills because of inflation.the wars we are supporting.  Our country is going to hell because of Biden.  I am crying.\n\u56de\u590d @MSNBC @CapehartJ Insult women? You called Laken Riley, Lincoln.  You called her killer illegal and then corrected to, \u201cundocumented\u201d.  Never saying he was sorry for calling her a wrong name.  Our country was not built by them.  My grandparents and maybe yours built it.  They were legal.\n\u56de\u590d @mmpadellan Joe has been lying his whole life.  Said he was arrested during a civil rights event, about his scholarship, had three degrees,about his house burning, top of his class, worked in the coal mines, Saw the bridge collapse in Pittsburg, never discussed his son\u2019s business, etc.\n\u56de\u590d @Damaan4u33 Yeah, he sounds like a really intelligent individual, but\u2026\u2026 https://t.co/yFoSI524CB\n\u56de\u590d @mmpadellan Tell me what your lineup has done for our country?\n\u56de\u590d @TheOnlyEsta Really, the border, inflation, Afghanistan, two wars, Haiti,  fuel.  He lies about involvement with his son\u2019s business.  Biden is the worst President.  WE NEED TRUMP\n\u56de\u590d @TheOnlyEsta One is put on a pedestal because she is a Democrat.  The other is shunned by the press and has not got any recognition despite what she did for children .  They are both beautiful and should be treated equally.  Shame on the biased media.\n\u56de\u590d @kangaroos991 He doesn\u2019t pose in a uniform .You put him there.  Why do you lie?\n\u56de\u590d @BetteMidler Covid, buddy.  Fauci shut everything down.  He and the CDC.  Trump wanted it left open.\n\u56de\u590d @GuntherEagleman What happened to Diversity, Equality and Opportunity?.  Free speech is dead at MSNBC.  What a toxic work environment.\n\u56de\u590d @dizzle_que No. She and Psaki laughed at the fact that Va. voters named immigration as a no. 1 concern.  Yet, an illegal committed murder just 30 miles from Psaki\u2019s 1.7 million dollar home.  She is a disgrace and lies.\n\u56de\u590d @funder Really.  The 6 feet mandate had no research to back it.  He created fear, caused schools to close for no reason, said shots will prevent covid.  Shots now causing heart problems.  People I know had all vaccines, still became ill with Covid???  He is evil.\n\u56de\u590d @simonateba @MSNBC @maddow Can you honestly say this was a fair trial? The judge was chosen for one reason. To convict Trump.  Bragg campaigned on convicting Trump.  He had a gag order, yet Cohen went on all the talk shows.  The jury was given orders that confused them and not based on testimony.\n\u56de\u590d @catturd2 No Joe Biden had a bad 3 1/2 years.  Trump\u2019s speech was amazing.\n\u56de\u590d @KamalaHarris @JoeBiden Hey, your party just released the protesters who destroyed and took over Columbia with no consequences, illegals killing our women,  on the verge of WW111 with his foreign policies.  Your policies are wrecking the very foundation our country was founded on.  In Nov.,  you\u2018re done\n\u56de\u590d @funder Democracy left when he was elected.  He weaponized the CIA, the FBI, and the DOJ, and used them for his benefit.  I believe in karma.  Trump will come ourt ahead.\n\u56de\u590d @JDunlap1974 They have to work 2 or 3 jobs under Biden because of inflation and high gas prices.  Biden has made living in America extremely hard.

Pathetic.\n\u56de\u590d @bruce_steiner Then explain why they waited eight years, knowing he was running for President,  to bring up these illegitimate charges?  By the way, check the background if all the people bringing up these charges.\n\u56de\u590d @BidensWins Yes, what a hypocrite. He goes to the most secured border, thanks to the governor.  He should have gone to Eagle Pass or Arizona.  They are coming from all over the world, and we are paying for it.  My grandparents came here legally, and worked their way to citizenshi.\n\u56de\u590d @JoeBiden You have a huge fundraiser today, while PRESIDENT TRUMP is a a wake for a downed police officer  who was killed because of the lax laws in NY Thanks to Democrats.\n\u56de\u590d @Stcash4all @MSNBC @CNN @nytimes @washingtonpost I have been asking that question fir three years.  Biden has destroyed our country from the beginning.  I cannot afford gas, groceries, meds, restaurant, utilities, etc.  Borders are a mess, widespread crime.  Face it, this would not happen under Trump.\n\u56de\u590d @harrisonjaime Now here\u2019s what he didn\u2019t do.  Border wide open, runaway inflation.  He did not create jobs.  These people went back to work after COVID.  Relieve student loans, a joke.   Now the taxpayers have to pay that bill.  Billions to illegals, nothing to vets.\n\u56de\u590d @Markfry809 Hey, you got this all wrong.  Biden gets that title.  Have you seen Biden at a microphone?  He gets lost 90 % of the time. Inflation all time high.  7 million Illegals taking over our country.  I can\u2019t pay all my bills and now we have to pay off student loans. Biden wins\n\u56de\u590d @Damaan4u33 No, but I would remove Robert DeNiro\u2019s\n\u56de\u590d @DefiyantlyFree You are a disgrace.  Maybe you should live in China or Russia.
