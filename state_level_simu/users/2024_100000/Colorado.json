I'm all for homemaking, but this is not the 70s. It's harder than ever to support a family as inflation goes up. Men are mentally working themselves into depression trying to provide alone.\n\u56de\u590d @RadfemBlack Any statistics from pornhub should always be taken with a grain of salt. They lie a lot and have too many lawsuits to be taken seriously. Pleasure and pain can exist in safe and consensual settings. Sex and violence can not. The two are not the same. Pornhub is sexual violence\n\u56de\u590d @fujostarion Especially when it comes to male gaze vs. female gaze and consent. Porn desensitizes men and young boys to believe that what girls/women \"want\" or \"respect\"/respond to the best is violence/coercion. And pushes inc*st, cp, etc. They also ignore any acknowledgment toward consent.\n\u56de\u590d @PaulyToad25 Thank you. I've been saving it for the perfect conversation. Some of them have a lot of baggage but expect women with little to no baggage to deal with theirs, no questions asked. All while they neglect their own is crazy.\n\u56de\u590d @1972Doc I'm with you on that one.\n\u56de\u590d @HazelAppleyard_ They also wanted to stop teen pregnancy and single motherhood in the 70s  because they noticed most older men would exploit underage girls/teen and would use and manipulate them for sex  by convincing them they were in love.\n\u56de\u590d @notcrypticno \ud83d\ude02 Remind me of things like the Cold War Condom Drop. Where America planned to drop thousands of extra large condoms and labeled them medium and small to intimidate German men as psychologically warfare.\n\u56de\u590d @uzbadyubi That's  exactly how p*dophiles/groomer continues to flourish. They rely on children being innocent/naive/impressionable/gullible to fulfill their sick fantasy\ud83e\udd22 They know exactly how to choose their victims. When kids are actually educated on it, they are more likely to speak up.\n\u56de\u590d @_nomadic_soul Men don't want to understand. They believe that women are just being emotional, and this is just based off of feeling but men have shown over and over why they should by responding violently. Wouldn't you say that's emotional?\n\u56de\u590d @robkhenderson Yeah I can tell this article didn't talk to actual women. Women  are not into that stuff the way that men think they are. Most women do not like WATCHING porn because the pleasure is rarely about the women. Most women like erotic audios. Quinn for example has gotten popular...\n\u56de\u590d @StackingWs @pearlythingz As a women I agree with everything you said. One of the few sane people out there. I wish there was more ADULT conversation about this than just arguing and blaming each other\n\u56de\u590d @isabellayonce A lot of women and men don't report it for that reason. They don't feel like it qualify as being called rape. It's even more confusing when a child goes through it since they don't understand what's happening to their bodies and why it's reacting in that way.\n\u56de\u590d @_celia_bedelia_ Studies show that it literally takes on average 7 attempt to permanently get away from an abuser\n\u56de\u590d @Thaleresq @jakeshieldsajj I've been reading up on it lately and there is a pretty big reason he did, what he did. I'm not at all saying that Hit1er was  right or handled it in the wasn't because they were just jewish but America will never teach the truth to cover up for Isreal\n\u56de\u590d @Advo_Katy Let also not forget the sextortion cases of teenage boys, some that resulted in suicide the past year or so. Children are struggling and need proper sex Ed not porn. They need to learn consent from an early age, and they need limited access to internet\n\u56de\u590d @revelfemme Before feminism young boys didn't have many laws protecting them. They made it possible for there to be an age of consent for boys against adult men because there wasn't really any until the 90s do to the HIV/AIDs epidemic. Men also didn't want their son to be gay.\n\u56de\u590d @joeymama2121 @ubelfem True but even though they are barely legal...why do you think they have girls that already look underage infantilize themselves even farther. What 18-19 year old do you know wear literal kid clothes, light up shoes, and wear ponytails while licking a lollipop simultaneously.\n\u56de\u590d @CollinRugg Do I agree with what happened to Kaylee? Not at all. I hope she does recover, but don't paint her out to be just a innocent victim when she started the bullying and planned the fight. There is only so much someone being bullied can handle before they snap.\n\u56de\u590d @freedomML3 @kennyjenx @_Re_UPS Wasn't her boyfriend and most of her friends black? Plus in the video you can see a black girl try to defend her but someone else jumped in started fighting that girl.\n\u56de\u590d @robkhenderson Women love BDSM but not in the way that porn shows it. BDSM is NOTHING like porn shows. That's the problem. Women don't like violence they like giving partial/total control in a comfortable and safe setting, not violence. Even fifty shades is a shitty depiction of that.\n\u56de\u590d @wheresurhusband @Cluffalo Yeah, that's also lacking social skills. That actually does more harm than good. If sex is the first thing to come to mind when you think of \"intimacy\" and social skills that's not good. Making out with drunk girls is to you can practice social skills sounds predatory\n\u56de\u590d @_nomadic_soul The question wasn't \"Would you rather be raped and murdered by a bear or a man?\" The question was,\"Would you rather be alone or come across a man or a bear in the woods.\" Men made up all the murder/rape scenarios and memes. That's why women chose the bear. You gave them examples\n\u56de\u590d @DoomScroling It's worst than what you think\n\u56de\u590d @HarrietCarried One 10 year old was raped by her deacon at 9. Her mom forced her to get married to the man who raped her who was in his 20s. She had 5/6 kids by the time she was 16 years old. One of the saddest stories I've heard.  Victims aren't old enough to divorce, so they're trapped  til 18\n\u56de\u590d @AZVotes Laws to protect boys from men are still pretty new.   It wasn't until the 60s feminist movement that they requested laws also protecting boys under 18 from being abused/sexual exploited. Conservative christians fought to keep it 16 (and still do).  They don't want to protect boys\n\u56de\u590d @FearedBuck Isn't that called Tantric sex. It's supposed to ground and connect the mind, body, and soul while releasing built-up sexual energy. It's supposed to be really useful for men, too, and could help them reach multiple orgasms\n\u56de\u590d @PaulyToad25 It's honestly just the start of grooming. That's how they \"test the waters\" to see if the child's the perfect victims.  The more the victims tolerate and try to brush it off as nothing, the harder they push and the worse it gets, especially if they think they won't get caught.\n\u56de\u590d @joeymama2121 @ubelfem The whole reason the teen category got taken down was because they were getting caught up. They've verified several videos of underage girls. They cater to violence. If they had nothing to hide why did they delete 80% of their content.\n\u56de\u590d @j0rdan0fjupit3r @denimneverdies It's from the website Exodus Cry. Trigger warning, though.

It was a soap opera that wove in supernatural &amp; gothic storylines within typical family drama &amp; romantic entanglements. There were elements of science fiction too! It\u2019s an incredible show that has lasted longer than its peers\nHi Tarrell! @odaat_webseries does such an amazing job mixing classic soap stories of families &amp; romance but also the really wild &amp; campy type stories that we all love. I especially love the stories involving Frederick, Abby &amp; Antonio\u2019s Casino from hell!\n\u56de\u590d @olderbrother21 Hi Tarrell! Their reasoning was there just was not enough to fill in that category which I guess makes sense but it\u2019s a bummer that the younger actors will have to now compete in the bigger categories\n\u56de\u590d @olderbrother21 Hi Tarell!

It think maybe some soap writers know that there is a formula and certain love triangles hit home to longtime viewers. The problem is when it\u2019s an unpopular couple that\u2019s getting yet another break up that no one is invested in.\n\u56de\u590d @olderbrother21 Hi Tarrell, classic soap storytelling still centers around interactions we all have on a daily basis w/family &amp; friends, coworkers &amp; significant others. Also watching those stories unfold over time on a soap rather than conclude in 1 hour allows the viewer to really invest too.\n\u56de\u590d @olderbrother21 Hi Tarrell, I don't think thats necessarily how I would describe #DarkShadows' method of storytelling. All shows then and now have story arcs. Telenovelas are more like limited run series and tend not to last more than 3 yearsish. Some even shorter than that.\n\u56de\u590d @olderbrother21 Hi Tarrell. I think the classic supers were such a phenomenon, especially the #DAYS couples who I think really wrote the book on this, make it hard for new ones to sprout. It\u2019s a lot to live up to.

My recollection was that he sort of underperformed in most of those years or wasn\u2019t as dominant as his overall reputation implies.\n\u56de\u590d @Joshua__DM Totally.  It\u2019s not like it\u2019s singing Sweet Caroline for no reason or anything.\n\u56de\u590d @Segway_Batman His post is a legitimate criticism of the disjointed, inconsistent and at times counterproductive bike infrastructure in Chicago.  We need a comprehensive plan, not piecemeal ward by ward efforts.\n\u56de\u590d @stacydavisgates Why?  Is this how you get downtown from your place in IN?\n\u56de\u590d @ChicagoBreaking They are putting the cart before the horse.  First, IL/Chicago needs to remove the law that customers forfeit excess solar production annually.  Next they need to figure out how to subsidize reinforcing older roofs to support panels.  Then they need to subsidize panels.  Be smart\n\u56de\u590d @VikiVice @RayRebekka \u2018Sewage treatment plant.

I\u2019m pointing out shelter is used by local governments to generate revenue to fund community services.  Without private property, SFHs/Condos/Apartments, cities like Chicago would have to find another major source of revenue to fund city services.  That is my point.\n\u56de\u590d @wondrashoots That Body Glove bathing suit is the tops!\n\u56de\u590d @AbhayPotluri125 @DannyDrinksWine I like and jave seen most of Scorsese\u2019s movies.  This isn\u2019t one of his best.  It was good, nothing special and to me not Best Picture quality.   I found it lacking in character development, glossing over several interesting narratives and long for the sake of being long.\n\u56de\u590d @leahfrombklyn @BlkNtvTerraFFVI How do you know the tenant is desperate?  Negotiating doesn\u2019t = desperation.  It could mean they are savvy or that they are looking at units that exceed their budget for a variety of reasons that have nothing to do with desperation.\n\u56de\u590d @CitizenVMachine Yes, it also helps police and paramedics locate victims of gun crimes faster.  Additionally, having this technology helps law enforcement and violence \u2018disruption\u2019 folks know where to focus resources to stop escalating violence.  \u2018Evidence\u2019 for her is a very vague term.\n\u56de\u590d @Milkczar @UrbanEnviroIL Dude, my favorite Chinese restaurant in Chicago is just out of focus on the left hand side.

Owners do the \u2018Bear\u2019 minimum (pun at your leisure) b/c fans will come anyway.  Maybe if they were all in every year their might be more public support.  The bluff to move to AH didn\u2019t help.\n\u56de\u590d @NorthRenters The owner does.  You are really naive.  Renters pay for a service, which is housing.  As part of that arrangement they don\u2019t have the risk or responsibility to maintain the shelter.  It\u2019s not complicated.  It\u2019s clear you believe every home owner or LL is a slumlord. You\u2019re wrong.\n\u56de\u590d @jacksonpCTU I got a bridge over the East River for sale, great potential, is the CTU interested?

It\u2019s got a great water feature.\n\u56de\u590d @whstancil Many families have no choice but to be a dual income house.  There is a set of families who choose this for purely material reasons or because one or both partners derive their sense of worth from working.  Also, staying home and running a household is work.\n\u56de\u590d @CBSNews @camiloreports A free trip to Italy does sound like an excellent deterrent!\n\u56de\u590d @bicyclizt @culturecanceler Separate issues.  OP mentioned from O\u2019Hare to McCormick.  What sort of demand do you think there is for Suburban people taking Metra to El to get to O\u2019Hare?\n\u56de\u590d @Andrefor40th Exactly.  You\u2019ve laid bare that the Mayor and his DSA supports in CC are just the new machine.  The only difference is they\u2019re sanctimonious and less competent.  The only thing they care about is maintaining their power and pushing their divisive agenda.  Stop hanging with them!\n\u56de\u590d @secupp Yeah, it\u2019s totally a rally around the flag moment when the primary source fermenting political violence in this country is a target of political violence.  U reap what U sow and Trump has been sowing some pretty fucked up shit.  Violence is unacceptable but this isn\u2019t surprising\n\u56de\u590d @nypost Are there people out there that actually enjoy his commentary?\n\u56de\u590d @SwannMarcus89 The funny thing is her first few sentences establish a false premise.  Gentrification is certainly talked about a lot but there is little to no actual studies on its impact to society.  People move.  Figure out how to stay or go.  Just like the ancestors that brought you here.\n\u56de\u590d @JGrantGlover Saving as many two flats from conversion to SFHs is the probably the lowest hanging fruit.  Adjusting ADU to allow building up instead of down would be good too.\n\u56de\u590d @leo_szac LL could always return the payment with a description of \u2018payment in full required\u2019.

Powerful athlete! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\n#pdchitownclassic Sophia Hall, setter Ignite 16 Premier, is a great server as well as off coord for her team.

Great athlete!\n#pdchitownclassic Mia Ortiz is a six rotation player for FIVB 16U Daph.  She is a multi-sport athlete, cause you don\u2019t kick a volleyball like that unless you are on the pitch as well \ud83d\udd25.  She can set, hit on the right side exceptionally well, play defense, and as OH pure power!\n#pdchitownclassic Aimee Meraz, libero for Ignite 16 Premier.  Meraz is very athletic, has a great platform, and had some awesome digs to try to stave off their opponents today.  She was the lifeline that kept her team playing through the second set.\n#pgchitownclassic Julia Zamudio, libero for Ignite 15 Premier, is really good at her job.

She can do it all and by that I mean, she has a great platform, awesome speed, and tons of power when tooling off the block making recovery nearly impossible or just pwr hitting!\n#pdchitownclassic Alana Von Wychen, maybe best libero I have seen today.  She plays for the VVVBC 16-Purple and is very, very good.  She has quick feet, great range of motion, strong athletic build and a great platform.  She can dig, set, save, and hit from back row.  Amazing!\n#pdfreshmanshowcasene Jordan Frink, 5\u20198\u201d outside hitter from Skutt Catholic, class of 2028.  Great speed and platform.  I\u2019d play this athlete anywhere on the court.

Great foundational skills!\n#pdchitownclassic Aubree Westerfield, RS/Setter for Belusa United 16 Ice.
