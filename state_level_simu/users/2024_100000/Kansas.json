No one is threatening or blocking anyone. In fact, I hope the minister takes time to talk to teachers. For real. We all should be on the same team as teachers are wanting to ensure accountability for funding for future budgets. What\u2019s wrong with that?\nNo festivals for my band this summer (that might change), but what a time we had last year with this band playing at great places like All Folk'd Up Music Festival Inc.!
