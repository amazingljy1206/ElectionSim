I completely agree with Candace. Most Jewish people also think it's weird. It's not antisemitic to call out corruption or immoral things just because they're Jewish!\n\u56de\u590d @WatchChad When I used to live in S CA we had neighbors that worked at the local prison &amp; we had a conversation about this. They said the problem is that it doesn't work because they just end up using objects to sexually abuse kids! We need the death penalty for these sick people.\n\u56de\u590d @DC_Draino We the people need to revolt &amp; stop paying the unconstitutional income tax!  Best documentary showing how income tax is illegal &amp; the 16th amendment wasn't Constitutionally ratified. https://t.co/HidVtXtGXm\n\u56de\u590d @thehealthb0t Of course there is a community note!

Planes have always had contrails but this is completely different.\nThese groomers need to be stopped. There's laws that state children cannot be in bars, bikini bars, or strip joints, and for good reason! There needs to be a law that states kids cannot be in/around drag shows!

I remember about 19 years ago there was a few really deep earthquakes &amp; I remember telling my friends that a volcano was going to go off somewhere because even then I understood about pressure &amp; a few days later a dormant volcano went off in Iceland.\n\u56de\u590d @libsoftiktok Absolutely evil &amp; illegal!!! All parents should pull their kids out of public schools till they actually stop this madness &amp; go back to actually teaching, not indoctrinating. Anyone working in schools that thinks this is ok needs to be fired.\nNATO isn't about peace anymore. Since they just want to push war for $$$ &amp; control we should leave the UN.  \"The parties to this treaty reaffirm their faith in the purposes &amp; principals of the United Nations &amp; their desire to live in peace with all peoples &amp; all governments\" https://t.co/L6SDjuRHqU\n\u56de\u590d Being charged if you do defend yourself, or now being taxed more for not conserving water but also having your home insurance cancelled due to fire danger, &amp; on &amp; on, then you're a communist!

They need to be charged with treason &amp; we need Nuremberg 2.0!\n\u56de\u590d Not sure if this young lady was influenced or not or if she started transitioning or not but it truly does depend on the people around these young confused kids.

Then 10 years later it happened again so my dad &amp; step mom knew there was mold somewhere &amp; they found that the water heater had a slow leak &amp; was causing mold again. Fixed &amp; removed the mold &amp; no seizures.\n\u56de\u590d @NaturallyFTW I'm honestly not sure. He had a friend who had family in Asia that would mail him a big box of the leaves &amp; he would make tea &amp; capsules from it. He drank the juice when he could find/afford it.

I honestly think kids today wouldn't even know how to use a dictionary. So many can't even read cursive.\nThis sadly isn't surprising. I'm sure it's illegal immigrants/sleeper cells that were allowed into our country thanks to Biden &amp; Harris!\nAnd they target &amp; try to stop those who cure cancer naturally like they tried to do to Dr. Burzynki in TX.

God doesn\u2019t take your moment of asking to rebuke you. \u201cDo you really deserve this?\u201d No, He just gives generously.  He doesn\u2019t care to give you whatever you want.

Basically seals his demise in November.\nYou have to realize no matter what you\u2019re going through in life that God never has a mood swing, He never changes His mind, and He still believes in you.  He\u2019s so far above everything we face on this earth.  Opposition will come, but Jesus has already overcame it. (John 16:33)\nMy favorite verse in Psalm 57:2.  \"I will cry out to God Most High, To God who performs all things for me.\"  All things. Not some things. All things. I don't have to stress, strive, or worry. All I have to do is pray and speak. God performs all things for me.\nI\u2019m not for separation of church and state. However, politicians need to stay in their lanes and focus on electability instead of trying to act like preachers.  You can\u2019t be a preacher and a politician. So PICK ONE or GET OUT.\nThe Democrats didn\u2019t order Trump\u2019s assassination attempt.  People much higher than the Democrats did.  This is why we have to win in November.

The Bible says if you believe in your heart that God raised Jesus from the dead &amp; confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, you\u2019re saved. Boom. That simple.  Now, your doctrine might be terrible. But you\u2019re saved.\n\u56de\u590d @jessemorgan88 Oh my goodness! Praying!! Never forget what the Lord said in His Word.

It makes sense that Jesus would continue this work and ministry in His Church today around a table. Much healing can take place at table.\nJesus had a radical trust in God. He trusted in God\u2019s presence during a violent storm. He trusted in God\u2019s power over death while grieving the loss of a friend. He trusted in God\u2019s will even while facing the cruelest of suffering.\nUNDER MY ROOF, part two When we think of \u201croof\u201d we think of buildings, in this case a house. A house is a dwelling place, a place to gather, a place of hospitality &amp; welcome. In addition to being a sacrifice,the Eucharist is also meal;it is a Sacrament of welcome and hospitality.\n\u56de\u590d Yes, whether we choose to receive from the cup at Mass or not (and it is a free choice; no one is required), there is a risk in following Jesus. What risks have you encountered in your walk with Christ?\n\u56de\u590d Today the Church begins Holy Week. It is PALM SUNDAY OF THE LORD\u2019S PASSION. (The word \u201cpassion\u201d comes from a Latin word meaning \u201cto suffer.\u201d)\nWhere is Jesus sending you to serve this Lent? It might be somewhere unexpected, even somewhere we fear going. But one thing is for sure, we will not be sent out alone!\nYesterday we celebrated the feast of St Elizabeth Ann Seton; today, St John Neumann. Both local! Both gave their lives in service. Both in love with Jesus! Let\u2019s folllow Jesus today as they did! Sts Elizabeth Ann Seton &amp; John Neumann, pray for us! \ufffc\nCome to the Feast of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary! Thursday, August 15: Mass at 7am, 9am and 7pm.\n\u56de\u590d Like a grain of wheat that dies (Jn 12:20-33) Patrick risked all &amp; dying to self, through the Holy Spirit, he produced good fruit for the sake of the Kingdom of God.What sacrifices will we willingly make to share the Gospel?What sacrifices will we make to share the love of God?\n\u56de\u590d Tho he stumbled, Peter\u2019s heart was always full of love for Jesus. May our faith in Christ lead us to a deeper love for our Savior who never gives up on us! https://t.co/VGCEhbZjpa\nWhat better way is there to celebrate the Feast of the Sacred Heart of Jesus today than by sharing the love He has put into our hearts! https://t.co/78VgaIvL2H\nAn extra day in February deserves an extra post!Communion along with Participation &amp; Mission are Synod words.Our journeying together as Church must be done in the profound spirit of Communion whereby all are called &amp; empowered to Participate in the life &amp; Mission of Jesus Christ!\nMonday March 11:  UNDER MY ROOF, part one In every Mass, we echo the words spoken once to Jesus by a Roman centurion whose servant was quite ill (Mt 8:5-10): \u201cYou do not even need to come under my roof,\u201dthe centurion tells Jesus, \u201cOnly say the word and my servant will be healed.\u201d\n\u56de\u590d Before His crucifixion, Jesus asked his disciples if they could drink of the cup from which He will drink (Mt. 20: 17-28). He is asking about their willingness to give their life, to love and even to sacrifice and suffer as He will.\n\u56de\u590d Furthermore, to share our love &amp; compassion with others, to give our real presence to another, to offer our time, money or other resources to those in need, very often requires \u201cbreaking open\u201d our fearful heart, or prying open a fixed attitude or blinders that limit our vision.\nFebruary 28: DRINK THIS CUP There is something a little risky about sharing in the Eucharistic cup. Taking the cup from a minister, drinking from a common vessel, handing it back \u2013 the entire action seems a bit \u201cdangerous,\u201d if you will. Perhaps this is as it should be.\nMarch 25:  THIS IS MY BODY It was a real body that hung on the cross. Receiving Holy Communion at Mass is not just a spiritual exercise. When we receive the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist, it is not only our soul that is nourished. It is our physical body, too.\n\u56de\u590d We who believe in Christ\u2019s real presence in the Eucharist must practice His radical HOSPITALITY&amp; INCLUSION.What if this is the measure of our worship,not the finest vestments nor the gold of the chalice nor how loud we sing and pray?Help us Lord to see Your presence in all people\nThis Sunday: We celebrate the \u201cAscension of the Lord\u201d and Mother\u2019s Day \u2014 two great reasons to come to Mass! Saturday 5:30pm; Sunday at 7:30a 9a 10:30a and 12 Noon.\nAT TABLE WITH CHRIST JESUS Jesus ate with all the \u201cwrong\u201d people; that\u2019s what He was accused of (Luke 5:27-32). Along with friends and followers, Jesus ate with sinners, those diseased and impure, outcasts, opponents, even with one who denied Him &amp; the one who betrayed Him.\n\u56de\u590d \u201cLord Jesus, may every Eucharist inspire us to offer what little have, just as while dining at the home of Zacchaeus, you inspired him to share with the poor.\u201d (Luke 19:1-10)\nMarch 17, part one: SACRIFICE  It\u2019s not a popular word. But all spouses &amp; parents know that sacrifice is at the root of love. There is no love without sacrifice. Once you know this, the phrase \u201cthe Sacrifice of the Mass\u201d makes perfect sense.\nLast Sunday we heard Jesus\u2019 relatives say He was \u201cout of his mind.\u201d Perhaps only Jesus would be \u201ccrazy\u201d enough to compare something as great &amp; glorious as the Kingdom of God to a tiny mustard seed or a field of wheat (Mk 4:26-34), as we hear this Sunday.\nAll seniors from any high school are invited to join us this Sunday, June 2nd, at the 10:30am Mass, for a Graduation Blessing!\n\u56de\u590d Listen to these strong words from St Augustine: \u201cAll who fail to keep the bond of peace after entering this mystery receive not a sacrament that benefits them, but an indictment that condemns them. We must live the peace of Christ we celebrate in the Eucharist!\nTomorrow, March 1, is First Friday. Our Adult Faith Formation Team is sponsoring a brief presentation on the significance of the Eucharistic Prayer (the long prayer at Mass during which we kneel) led by Fr. Rich immediately following the 9AM Mass in Pedata Hall. All are welcome.\n\u56de\u590d Wine is a symbol of joy. First, then, to be at table with Christ Jesus means to have our hearts filled \u2014 overflowing!!! \u2014 with joy and gratitude!\n\u56de\u590d This is what Eucharistic is for, what Sunday is for: to be invited and welcomed by Christ, and also to invite and welcome Christ, to sit and listen and learn, to offer ourselves fully, to be united with Christ and recreated in Him.\n\u56de\u590d Not only has Christ invited us to this great heavenly banquet but we get a taste of its joy right here &amp; now when celebrate the Eucharist at Mass. This supper began the night before Jesus died when He identified this meal as the new Passover and He as the Lamb of sacrifice.\nMarch 17 part 2: THE SACRIFICE OF ST PATRICK  Happy St Patrick\u2019s Day! St Patrick lived in the 5th century. At 16 he was sold into slavery in Ireland.
