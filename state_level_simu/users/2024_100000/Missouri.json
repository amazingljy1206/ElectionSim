The new large deal for reportedly 28 mil with signature shoe is new yes. But she'd already had 2 yrs of Nike $ too\n\u56de\u590d @darrenrovell @HerkyCyclone How? She hasn't taken any from the collective before and wouldn't if she had stayed. It's you that doesn't understand her situation. She's not taking a pay cut going pro. That premise is completely utterly false.\n\u56de\u590d @RainyDaysUtube @lucysreputation Folks that enjoy certain genres bash others all the time that's not going away.\n\u56de\u590d @NinerNick_22 The Williams 'situation' isn't a situation. He doesn't even need camp. So long as hes signed by the week before game 1 that's fine. BA will probably be traded it sounds like. Team will still be good.\n\u56de\u590d @RpsAgainstTrump It's her stage though... She can say what she wants and do with it what she wants. It's the audience that can decide if they like it or not and choose to stay or keep coming back. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\u56de\u590d @natfluential Rookie is crafty. I like it.\n\u56de\u590d @idgaf593182 @linzsports That about sums it up. When a 2nd yr player coming off ROY level play is stinking it up like she has through 4 games now it's fair to call a spade a spade. This isn't some tit for tat.\n\u56de\u590d @ChadLeistikow Definitely need a 4th DT to emerge. And everyone to stay healthy\n\u56de\u590d @CollinRugg Trigger happy ass cop. Those guys are just itching for a reason to pull the trigger on something or someone. There's times for using deadly force no doubt. That's NOT one of em\n\u56de\u590d @SWiltfong_ @HawkeyeReport @ChadSimmons_ @PeteNakos_ If 2 out of 3 isn't bad how's 3 out of 3? This one sounds like hes a spitting image of AJ and that alone has his potential through the roof.\n\u56de\u590d @DavidEickholt This can't be talked about more. Where else would a coaching change not result in mass transfers/decommits? That's impressive as all get out\n\u56de\u590d @MonstaNerd34 @robertawbb The thing is after being corrected she didn't really apologize and kept on keeping on with throwing shade. To this day obviously. She did all that lying initially with a purpose. Cause if it was all innocent on her part why continue how she has?\n\u56de\u590d @838_carlisle What's hilarious about it? I see no humor in it. Kate has no pressure on her to be a 6th man. Clark has the weight of the league on her. If teams guarded and treated Martin (or anyone else) like they have Clark she'd be struggling too.\n\u56de\u590d @RebelRuckus78 @id6klub @HeavensFX She has an endorsement deal with Nike. Has for well over a year. They just haven't gotten her her own shoe yet\n\u56de\u590d @phoenix201814 @AlbertaLParish @WNBA @CathyEngelbert @GuardianUS @CaitlinClark22 Sorry I was jumping back to Angels initial tweet and referring to that and the why the mom had to interpret it for everyone.\n\u56de\u590d @MySportsUpdate If Jones is half serious he should rip that band aid off. Get rid of Dak whatever that takes now instead of waiting another yr and for Fs sake don't resign him. Why delay the inevitable and save some $ while they are at it\n\u56de\u590d @wingoz Hyde I think is retiring...\n\u56de\u590d @lporiginalg Bet she's got a closet full of fancy clothes the newest iPhone and a car payment with high interest. Goes out to eat multiple meals a week if not per day. And has no idea where her $ goes\n\u56de\u590d @aclassyteaparty Wtf is Clark playing big mins tonight would be my first q to her. She's got nothing in the tank. You weren't winning this gm no matter what. Shoulda just rested her. This schedule is stupid\n\u56de\u590d @HawkeyesHQ Brandon Wegher.
