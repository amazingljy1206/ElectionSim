Only outcasts that we condemn. I get the left claims they are with the right but that does not make it true. Projection.\n\u56de\u590d @MrSantosNY Sorry haters. I am with George.  Tells less lies than most politicians and his were at least fun rather than the bullshit we gotta deal with everyday from the rest.   Expelling you was unforgivably stupid. Good luck in court. Sincerely\n\u56de\u590d @CollinRugg He just gave a bunch of rich kids money. So? I know there are exceptions, but for the most part this is nothing to them.  If he went to a community college and did the same thing imagine the impact the same amount of money would have had on the students.   No hate, just saying\n\u56de\u590d @stillgray Taxes and culture did.  I loved smoking but the cost and being shunned everywhere I went to smoke became too much.   I have never been in as good of physical shape since I quit. I am still an athlete, but I felt healthier all around when I did smoke than now.  Crazy right?\n\u56de\u590d @MAGAlord2024 Words are not violence any person claiming they are should be locked away from society in a cell where they can enjoy all the tyranny they want.  Eat Sh*t and die commies.  Calling someone who is disabled a retard should be answered with the harshest of consequence. Not the same.\n\u56de\u590d @JustMyLittleBit @BrownEyeGirl_45 @bennyjohnson There is no border bill. There is a foreign aid package that had a provision in it that would completely open the border to over 3 million illegal immigrants a year and a year.  In other words it cemented the Biden open invasion policy. No border security, just lets in millions.\n\u56de\u590d @PatriotParents1 All about Vivek.  He is the only one who knows what we are up against.\n\u56de\u590d @EndWokeness We mean you hiring based on immutable characteristics rather than merit and that is a very bad idea.

So, not sure I get your point.  It wouldn't happen.\n\u56de\u590d @Lisahudsonchow7 What do you expect, democrats vote for pedofiles and violently attack you when you speak out against sexual deviance. That's the world now.\n\u56de\u590d @RagingKuJo1222 If they do not not stand up hard against this, they get what they deserve I suppose.  I guess NY could see how things work out if they quit instead of being reeducated.   Maybe things have changed that much, but I would not think the NYFD members gonna stand for this. I hope.\n\u56de\u590d @DailyWireNews Holy crap, South Park called it after all.  When Satire becomes reality. https://t.co/PEj7VIvl4G\n\u56de\u590d @lgbtqnation This is what the current alphabet community is all about now. Affirming mental illness and convincing children this is a quick path to peer acceptance.     There is no punishment bad enough for the people pushing this ideology.  None.\n\u56de\u590d @online_shogun @realDonaldTrump His lips do not match the words at all.    However he is right.  I support Israel but they are not doing this in a way a lot of the world is ok with.  I get their mission, but they need support other than half of US.\n\u56de\u590d @pinkcommunist @susanLanglois15 @JustinTrudeau @MarciIen Why is it hateful to not want someone's sexual preferences shoved in your face at every business or government interaction?   I have never cared what people do but I do not understand the perceived right to demand celebration for their sexaul desires and be naked in public.\n\u56de\u590d @AP Long way to go to stop these child abusers from sterilizing and mutilating their children.    Except Democrats. They should definitely continue to fight to abort and sterilize their children.\n\u56de\u590d @OWStarr Did what? Replace old forests the were brittle and susceptible to fire and weather with younger trees?  Oh no whatever will we do without old dangerous forest growth to catch fire and burn places so we can scream climate change.  You people are truly insufferable.\n\u56de\u590d @MattWalshBlog As a PT that works out 6-7 days a week, yes it is b far mostly food.  Part of the year I have model like abs, the other 4 months I get -tubby-. My workout does not change only my food intake.  Oct-February I eat whatever I want rest of the year I track and curate.\n\u56de\u590d @monkeymind23 @stillgray I am not saying they are wrong, in that they think the wrong thing. They know there was no crime committed  just like you do.  They chose to break the law and convict an innocent person because they hate him   The court, the jurors, the entire prosecution has zero legitimacy.\n\u56de\u590d @kimmagagal2 @_BruceBane @GuntherEagleman They will disappear with Epstein's I am sure.   If the authorities had any morals what so ever they would release those names right now as the police are arresting them today.  Why don't we know who they are already? Cause now they have been warned and can escape to safety.\n\u56de\u590d @ACLU Wait, he just opened the borer to thousands of people a day unfettered.  How are all the people in the comments so easily fooled?     Used word play to announce the border is wide open now.  2024, just wow.\n\u56de\u590d @ULTRA_MAJESTY Well, Yes.  Gateway doesn't matter on the same subnet, so unless your cable gets unplugged that is affirmative. Don't make me thing the OSI model layers and stuff lol.\n\u56de\u590d @stillgray Shoot, hold up for all the protests and burnt cities that are about to happen.  Oh wait, she white?   No one will care and if they do they will be called racist or a bigot and told they owe reparation's.     Prayers for her family.\n\u56de\u590d @MikeHudema Sweet more usable land to farm and plant trees that can absorb C02 you whine about.  Seems like a win to me.\n\u56de\u590d @_lithp @_Heteroclite_ @TheRabbitHole84 If that is the case I agree.   I however do not believe they believe what they say.  I think despite what people say to avoid struggle sessions or canceling 98% of people agree a man is not a woman.  They are just afraid to admit it because of what happens to dissenters.\n\u56de\u590d @VigilantFox Since THC became legal, edibles knock me out flat in even low dose.\n\u56de\u590d @SchenkAaron12 @FoxNews It is hateful and plan lazy to to push the mentally ill and suffering further down the rabbit hole of psychosis.

if you think you do, you're being taken advantage of by the beauty industry. you just need a decent cleanser, a decent moisturizer &amp; a good diet. &amp; no, decent doesn't mean $300\ni will never get sick of lana del rey's spoken word poetry album. the music is so twins peaks-esque and lana's voice is so soft and soothing. seriously nothing will ever compare to it.\ni don't think we'll ever fully get all the paint off everything.... i can't believe how much trouble two 15 month olds can get into....\nmy little girls call everything a kitty. squirrel? kitty. raccoon? kitty. sheep? kitty.\nok but like imagine this with pink pony club playing over it lol\nsylvia is asleep on my lap so of course vivian takes this opportunity to take her ponytail out and take all her clothes off bc i can't do anything rn\ni hate when you're watching a movie and the wigs are so bad and obvious and it just pulls you out of the whole thing like please please put a little bit of your budget towards good wigs\ni desperately need to change the needle on my record player. the twins keep grabbing it and i'm starting to hear a noticeable difference. i already have a new one but i've been so lazy changing it.\nseriously tho i bet lana comes out as a trump supporter by the end of the year\npeople who say they'd feel perfectly comfortable with their young daughters having to share change rooms with grown men should really not be allowed near children. your one job as a parent is to protect your kids, even if it makes people think you're \"not nice\".\n\u56de\u590d @horsefelon seriously i hate how people keep calling the brangelina one the original! i just ranted to my husband the other day how the real original with carole lombard is a certified classic\n\u56de\u590d @TheFoxMatriarch the right is what was trendy when i was younger but i always hated that style whereas the left was not trendy when i was younger but given the option i wouldve chosen that one even then bc its just the better and more classic look. i'd consider neither too young or too old tho.\nwhen i go to read an article and it says its exclusive for paid subscribers, i never get a sudden urge to subscribe. i just decide the article isn't worth my time. like you really want me to pay to read this garbage? no thanks\n\u56de\u590d @mrsautist i say go for it then! it does feel a lot better in summer to have short hair and if you end up hating it, it shouldn't take long to grow back.\nit sucks when you're not smart enough to put what you wanna say into words that people will understand. like i've come to accept that i'm just very bad at communicating my thoughts since everyone seems to misunderstand evwrything i say but i wish i knew how to get better at it\nanyone who thinks a child's difficulty level is directly connected to the mother's parenting style or personality really just needs to have twins. then you realize you can parent 2 kids exactly the same at the exact same time and they'll still behave differently\n\u56de\u590d @Alicia_Bittle_ my mother is catholic and my father was protestant and they were happily married til he died. yet 2 of my mum's brothers married catholic women and are now divorced. i don't think it correlates as much as one would think.\n\u56de\u590d @b_e_a_n_mom whats awful is where i live the only place that even has carts with spots for more than one kid is coscto which makes shopping everywhere else terrible bc i have to bring a stroller and carry a tiny little basket\ni'd like to think if we were all in one room together we'd all get along and laugh togwther at the goofy things our kids did and our differences in mothering wouldn't really matter the way they seem to online.\nseriously tho the amount of people without twins who tell me how much easier twins are than single babies.... like how do people even convince themselves this is true? like where does this line of thinking come from and why does everyone seem to believe it??? is it a cope?? idgi\ngreat weight loss tip: have kids who get mad every time you eat around them. soon enough you'll just stop eating!\n\u56de\u590d @hollowearthterf my husband loves when i show off my neck too. he also loves when i show off my upper back. but i guess those kind of go hand in hand lol. i always found those random but if he likes it, i like it.", "overlap_score": 0.1455227195675997, "MARITAL": "Married", "AREA": "Suburbs", "INCOME": "Middle Income", "RACE": "White Alone", "EMPLOYMENT": "Working now", "RELIGIOUS": "No religion", "PARTY": "Democratic Party", "AGE": "Youth (18-35 years old)", "IDEOLOGY": "Moderate", "GENDER": "Female"}, {"user_id": 1369602662, "screen_name": "Jennife99766325", "user_at_name": "JenniferJuniper", "sample_content": "\u56de\u590d @Marcilladrlph @Butters09016449 @JimVandeHei It was Ashley herself that questioned whether they were appropriate.

Both?\n\u56de\u590d @Sigh_in_Canada @DuffnerGeo87935 @N1S65 @apart_blown @GOPoversight He gave no medical diagnosis, though.

Funny, his dad wrote a book about Beau's illness and didn't even mention the burn pits once.\n\u56de\u590d @steve_vladeck @This_Redacted I did, though. And survived to tell the tale. In fact, I lived in an apartment at the time, so crappy it made the news after the pipes burst, and we were without water for weeks, AND I still recognize fear-mongering for what it is. And 2023, what power failure?\n\u56de\u590d @KevDGrussing Did you even read the report? Of course not.

How is it Hur's fault that Joe couldn't remember the approximate year of his son's death?\n\u56de\u590d @Ranger1135 @BuzzPatterson When that child starts voicing that it's probably not appropriate, then no, it's not normal.

I think Joe has shown for quite some time now cognitive decline .\n\u56de\u590d @herumaatra @MistyJernigan17 @ScooterCasterNY I can say I'm a unicorn, doesn't make me one. Are you seriously saying that because dude said he was cop that makes him a cop. And if you listen closely, it sounds like hes saying you guys beat up cops because they were hispanic.

There's enough shitty stuff going on in the political world, it's nice to get a win!\nIn the long term, this is not a good thing for the GOP. they are losing high propensity, affluent (donation $$$) voters that are giving dems an advantage in midterms, state legislatures, and special elections.

Clearly happy at what'd happened\n\u56de\u590d @STREET_FINCH She's quick to hug back, using the hold to softly bring Finch down onto the picnic blanket, the sun was out and it was a warm day!  \"Hi!!

But she's still grumpy..\n\u56de\u590d @HerCheeringHart \"You're like a model, my personal model..

No, not when she constantly talks like this.. it made Alice a little weak.   Starting to walk beside the goth mommy.  \"I can't take too much.. I'd feel like I'm taking from you..\"\nThen Alice will be grumpy.\n\u56de\u590d @ThatLocalNerd After a few more moments of longing gazing into her eyes, Alice just grabs Ruby, and picks her up.

I can't go without seeing her, then I won't see my brother..\"  She sighs, and kisses Ruby back, a hand on the other's stomach, just running it back and forth gently.   \"I love you, Ru..\"\n\u56de\u590d @BLEUBELLZ \"Easy mistake to make!\" She smiles and taps her fingers against the desk gently.  \"Ms. Logan is.. perfect.\"  For some reason, Alice prefers calling the older woman that..

Framed in the doorway of the pinioning room is the chair made in 1828 for Jane Scott. She was too weak to walk, and it was used to convey her to the public gallows which were erected facing the churchyard. https://t.co/O3YRVsAj1h\nThere are many lovely walks along the River Lune through Lancaster. The riverside paths are all nearly level and paved except for a short section approaching the Lune Aqueduct from the north bank.  https://t.co/ly2hvfdo3K\nThe LMS railway company commissioned Oliver Hill to design a new hotel in the then fashionable \u2018moderne\u2019 style that we would now call Art Deco.

Plots of land alongside the quay were sold off in 1751 and 1781 on which merchants rapidly built warehouses https://t.co/Ar845JaFCu\nThere has been a Regatta in Lancaster since 1842.  Rowing is thought of as a genteel sport so you would not expect it to be involved in such skulduggery as an electoral Royal Commission into bribery in 1865. All is revealed in our latest podcast  https://t.co/3UBPAqkuuA https://t.co/ElPOhRS9DZ\nThe first railway bridge over the River Lune lasted 20 years. 3 problems rose from the design: the threat of fire burning the timbers; water rotting the wooden beams; and the structure remaining stable when more, faster and ever-heavier trains crossed   https://t.co/ci0dp9KxxR\n'A picturebook castle' is how the castle at Hornby has been described. Painted by the artist Turner, it became famous and was much visited. It was built by the Norman Montbegon family just after they arrived in Lancashire.

He also signed two 1/3\n\u56de\u590d @Fenrirs_Chosen No, people like you have decided that people YOU DEEM \"nerds\" are a group of people who don't deserve protection from bullying and dehumanization.   Perhaps \"nerds\" should convert to Islam; if they did, you'd never criticize their alleged sexism and misogyny.\n\u56de\u590d @pnwguerrilla No, the United States exists because of the training the Continental Army received from the gay Prussian, Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben and because of military assistance from the French.   https://t.co/dTVp5UhwVI\nThe United States exists because of the training the Continental Army received from the gay Prussian, Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben and because of military assistance from the French.  https://t.co/dTVp5UhwVI\n\u56de\u590d @Falconer084 @Ghosty02772504 @Anna16892776 @mattyglesias I'm not sweeping anything under the rug.

I also find it fascinating that when racists try to deflect from the Atlantic Slave Trade, they always pretend that someone put a gun to Christian Europeans' heads and forced them to buy African slaves.\n\u56de\u590d @FeatherCastle87 @a_captain1197 @TommyInPA I haven't said anything about that.

I don't \"punch down\" and pick on people with no social status.   If your kind spent as much time going after college athletes as you do creating a moral panic about \"nerds\" and \"incels,\" something might get done about rape on college campuses.\n\u56de\u590d @Falconer084 @Ghosty02772504 @Anna16892776 @mattyglesias Lincoln's actions in the Dakota War are also not black and white.

It's the exact opposite.\n\u56de\u590d @WelchRobII First Blood is about a Vietnam Vet who is harassed by redneck cops because he has long hair and how he wages war against a small town in response to police brutality.   It's almost the definition of anti-establishment.\n\u56de\u590d @WelchRobII A lot of people have trouble processing doing what they are told will lead to success and then failing.

Once again, the Confederate Congress didn't authorize SLAVES to serve in the military until March 1865; even then, slaves were required to get permission from their states and owners, and they were not free after their service.\n\u56de\u590d @saladshooter9 I couldn't attractive a woman to save my life, and I don't mind Swift.

With the people I surround myself with, the least I want is to feel like a burden around them. I want to feel at peace with the people I spend my time with.\n\u56de\u590d If you genuinely express how you feel? How beautiful would it be if we were intentional about each other and if you lived each day wholly?\n\u56de\u590d You'll begin to reflect and sometimes feel guilty about how you could have been present or more available, don't dwell so much on it rather learn from it. Don't guilt trip yourself.\nIt's my birthday today and I want love letters. I\u2019d like to hear from you. I\u2019d like to know how my writings, friendship or anything I've done has made you feel. If you're interested, please send me a letter via my email: loluwa1805@gmail.com  I\u2019ll be looking forward to it\u2764\ufe0f\n\u56de\u590d Being the last born, the reality hits differently. I feel like I'm just starting my life whilst struggling to thrive in my twenties. Knowing that I might not be able to support my parents as my heart pleases breaks my heart.\n\u56de\u590d Isn\u2019t it lovely how we are able to bond, connect and show up for each other? How we are able to love someone in such a platonic yet very profound way?  I find it amusing how certain friendships are able to withstand every phase of one's life and still remain relevant and valuable\n\u56de\u590d I want to look at my man's face and be lost in fineness. I want to look at my man and lick my lips and say \u201cYummy \ud83d\ude0b\u201d.\n\u56de\u590d I believe I\u2019m a high maintenance friend cause I want to know my friend on a deeper level. Friendship is too deep to be causally used on someone you barely know. I want our friendship to be a safe safe. I want us to be vulnerable with each other.\n\u56de\u590d This month, I don\u2019t want to be expectant neither do I want to be disappointed. I don\u2019t want to get myself upset on things I\u2019ve handed to God. My goal is to live each day with so much positivity knowing that tomorrow would be better.\n\u56de\u590d You deserve someone who isn't just kind to you because of what you both share but because that's who they are. Be with someone whose core is kindness.\n\u56de\u590d Not all goodbye are sad. Some is the beginning to a new life and an in depth understanding of not allowing yourself to be suffocated or trapped because you  claim to be in love.\n\u56de\u590d In another few months or years, this too would pass and you\u2019ll be looking forward to the next big thing. To be honest, the circle never ends and that\u2019s why you need to make peace knowing that even when you don\u2019t know the \u201chow\u201d or \u201cwhen\u201d, everything you desire, you always receive.\n\u56de\u590d It\u2019s heartbreaking to know that even when you want to, situations don't permit you to give as much as you'd love to.\nIt's my Birthday today and I want some love letters.

You begin to doubt your existence. If you're good enough if you're deserving. You begin to wonder why you are not good enough for someone to want or accept you.\n\u56de\u590d Knowing that I am able to detach myself and also attach myself to people is one of my superpowers.\n\u56de\u590d I believe our past isn\u2019t just for us to learn from but to also remind us of certain phases and how things eventually worked out for good. Sometimes, our past is a reminder of how good life can be.\n\u56de\u590d Find happiness in the little things in life. Every day, choose to see the positive things in life. Create a list of things you want to do so you can always have something to look forward to. Grief and joy can co-exist. Don't starve yourself of the joy life has to offer.\n\u56de\u590d I know life might not be going as planned. I can understand how you have envisioned certain things to happen at certain times but, it\u2019s not even looking like anything good would be happening soon. See, hang in there.\n\u56de\u590d With effort, love never dies \u2018cause the person is constantly watering and trying to exceed your expectations of them.\n\u56de\u590d If you genuinely express how you feel? How beautiful would it be if you were intentional about each other and if you lived each day wholly?\nTalking stage stresses me especially when I like the person.   Can we just get to the part where I can shamelessly call you mine and wholeheartedly love you without feeling like I\u2019m doing too much for just a \u201ctalking stage\u201d?\nI strongly believe that romance cannot be taught. You are either romantic or you are not. There's no in-between. I also believe that people who have no iota of romance in them should flee from romantic people.\nWhen I think of intimacy, I think of the deep late night conversations. The one that gives an in-depth understanding of a person and their core. The one that allows you to see them for who they are. The one that exposes you to them and allows you to see them for who they are.\n\u56de\u590d How beautiful would it be if you gave your best today? If you decide to be a better partner, child or friend? If you decide to tell people how they truly make us feel? If you tell people how happy they make you feel or if you decide to forgive that person or seek closure.\n\u56de\u590d I largely believe that the depth of communication you are willing to have with someone is as deep as how vulnerable you want to get with them. Communication builds intimacy and if it is a relationship/ friendship you actually want to thrive, you can't dwell on the surface.\n\u56de\u590d If you\u2019re in love, spend time with your partner. Love up on each other. Take random pictures or videos of them. Inherit their hoodies and T-shirts \u2018cause the man you have today might not be yours tomorrow but the hoodie would always be yours\ud83e\udd2d.\n\u56de\u590d To be honest, we all have options. The options might not be our spec but they are still options. Now, seeing someone choose me despite my bad character and stubbornness makes me believe that men like a sprinkle of feminine shege-soft and cute\ud83e\udd2d.\nToday, I\u2019m grateful for dark-skinned men. The crispy dark ones that look like 7pm. The yummy men who are quick to remind me that God dey create and also confirm that you can have a fine face and a very wicked heart.  Very beautiful people filled with different levels of shege.\n\u56de\u590d For someone who has been labelled as being strong, especially by family and close friends, I largely believe one of the reasons I struggle with expressing myself or telling people what I\u2019m going through is because of the anticipated", "overlap_score": 0.1013415271165353, "MARITAL": "Never married", "AREA": "Cities", "INCOME": "Middle Income", "RACE": "Black Alone", "EMPLOYMENT": "Working now", "RELIGIOUS": "Christianity", "PARTY": "Independent", "AGE": "Youth (18-35 years old)", "IDEOLOGY": "Liberal", "GENDER": "Female"}, {"user_id": 1175836421929631744, "screen_name": "PMCJamaica", "user_at_name": "Providence Methodist Jamaica", "sample_content": "God\u2019s Transforming Word: When Kristin wanted to buy a special book for Xio-Hu, her Chinese husband, the only one she could find in Chinese was a Bible.

It\u2019s not acting upon one\u2019s beliefs that\u2019s the issue, it\u2019s the specific actions taken. A person can do positive or negative things in accordance with their beliefs.\nAnd it wasn't until centuries later, in 1982, that the words, 'I wanna reach out and grab ya', were added to the incantation.\nJacob said to Laban, \u2018I worked for you fourteen years for your two daughters and six years for your flocks, and to be frank, I got more sex out of your flocks than your daughters!\u2019 - Genesis 31:41\nCorrect me if I\u2019m wrong, but aren\u2019t laser beams light? https://t.co/0ZA2QKolMx\nOutbreak of mad tent disease at the Leeds festival.

Even their women exchanged natural sexual relations for unnatural ones, their fingers and lips exploring each other's naked supple bodies, their ample breasts brushing against\u2026 Just thinking about it makes me want to\u2026 rebuke myself\u2026 - Romans 1:26\n'I simply cannot fathom the moral rot in someone's soul that leads them to win an award for a movie about the Holocaust.' - Batya Ungar-Sargon  Sounds like Holocaust denial.

The rain came down, and the streams rose; yet his boat didn\u2019t float, because the rock was on the side of a mountain, and he was a mental patient. - Matthew 7:24-25\nWords like good, bad, and evil are how we label actions based on whether we view them as positive or negative. We also apply them to people based on their actions. It's like asking why tastiness exists. It 'exists' because there are things we consider to be tasty.\nNothing in all creation is hidden from God\u2019s sight. He sees you when you\u2019re sleeping, he knows when you\u2019re awake. He knows if you\u2019ve been bad or good, so be good for goodness sake. - Hebrews 4:13\nPaul told them, \u2018The Jewish people know all about me and my youthful hi-jinks.

Five of them were foolish and five were wise. The wise ones took lamps and were presented with roses, but the foolish ones got lost and ended up on Survivor. - Matthew 25:1-5\nDear Blue-Ticked Twitter accounts,  Please stop asking me what I notice about videos.
