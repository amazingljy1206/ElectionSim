It\u2019s the largest waste of generational talent!\n\u56de\u590d @evanempdx @NurkicCircus What I\u2019m saying is there is a time when you have to focus on actually developing and building a competitive team. You don\u2019t do that through drafts!   If Sharpe and Scoot show this season they aren\u2019t the answer then obviously you have to continue to draft.\nHonestly this is the dumbest take in all sports!   You can\u2019t say refs aren\u2019t supposed to do their job because the call was inconvenient to your entertainment!   Does it make it less climatic\u2026 sure but it\u2019s still basketball and it\u2019s still an illegal screen!\nPeople should really understand what a rivalry really is!

Clingan won\u2019t be used much in P/R scenarios\u2026 I think they will use him more for defense &amp; rebounds then anything\n\u56de\u590d @evanempdx @NurkicCircus My suggestion for them would be keep:  Ant Scoot Ayton Sharpe  Banton  Camara  Walker Williams  That\u2019s a solid core\u2026   Trade:  Thisse Grant Brogdan  Draft:  Players per role needs.

The Pedo shit isn\u2019t even really relevant to the win!\nIf you knew hoops you would understand what I\u2019m saying.

When did local courts get jurisdiction over federal offenses?\n\u56de\u590d @Search4TruthX @gmandan007 @AlexandraDixon @NormEisen @OutFrontCNN Couple of quick issues with your take. It\u2019s established precedent in election campaign law that what Trump did(the payment to Daniels) is not a violation.

They value diversity &amp; realize that if we don't have social justice, all of us suffer.\nSo far, Trump has stopped defaming E. Jean.

I see this world as a sinking ship, and the Gospel of Jesus Christ as a life boat. We can either try to save the ship and ultimately sink with it, or jump ship/go into the life boat and urge others to do so as well\u2026 If that makes sense\u2026\nWe ought to surround ourselves with people that care about our salvation. Individuals that are passionate about #Jesus and love his word. Those that align with our purpose, which is serving the Lord. Those who we can praise, worship, and endure with.\n\u56de\u590d @Beausvdbygrce The Sheep and the Goats is probably my favorite parable\u2026.

I thought I was doing God\u2019s work and helping accomplish his Will by voting such a way.

He corrected the misconception. \"Think not, that I came to bring peace, but rather division.\" Jesus didn\u2019t even let a man say bye to his household, nor bury his father.\n\u201cCome unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.\u201d - #Jesus  What a caring and loving Lord we have. A Lord that probably none of us deserves, but was given anyways thanks to God\u2019s never ending mercy.\n\u201cYet not My will, but Yours be done.\u201d - #Jesus   Dreams are a funny thing,  and unless our dreams(will) becomes God\u2019s dreams, rarely will they agree, because dreams are nothing but the selfish ambitions of our flesh. And we must deny the flesh.  \u201cLet him deny himself.\u201d\n\u201cYou are those who justify yourselves before men, but God knows your hearts. For what is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God.\u201d - #Jesus\n\u56de\u590d @Abrown444 Hopefully, they/we won\u2019t have to learn the hard way when Jesus returns.  But, before then. It\u2019s a lot though, a whole lot. The individuals prior to us had it easier, they didn\u2019t have to worry about television/technology. Deception has grown.\n\u56de\u590d But thankfully, Our God is a merciful God. So, merciful, that even though the youngest had left and squandered his living, he welcomed him back with open arms.  \u201cBut while he was still far away, his father saw him and had compassion, and ran, embraced, and kissed him.\u201d - #Jesus\nThe love of #Jesus. A love that\u2019s divine A love besides him, one shall  never find A love that won\u2019t leave you behind A love that left the ninety nine A love that gets better with time A love that is merciful, is kind A love that eases your mind That no man on earth can design.\n\u56de\u590d @BoeingJeff @TheMcGloneCode @HwsEleutheroi I feel the complete opposite. Before that even happened, I knew they were going to cook up something twice as nice. The chaos that it brung in 2020, they had to run it back. I\u2019m a disciple of Jesus first, and no politician echoes what he taught on the Mount. Jesus is his words.\nThe Savior has already come, but it seems as people are still looking for one, so to the election polls they run, choosing the world\u2019s candidates over God\u2019s Son. #Jesus #JesusChrist\n\"Beware, and be on your guard against every form of greed; for not even when one has an abundance does his life consist of his possessions.\" - #Jesus\n\u56de\u590d @HeavenzHalo31 I\u2019ve been thinking about this\u2026 Our purpose is to serve the Lord and follow in his footsteps. Spread the Gospel, feed the poor, clothed the naked, heal the sick, resist the devil, worship the Lord/listen to his commands, and etc.\n\u56de\u590d As Jeremiah states, \"The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked, who can know it?\" Well, #Jesus knew and knows it, which is why he emphasized it so much and gave us instruction on what to store, what to sell, what to treasure, and who/what to follow.\n\u56de\u590d @Abrown444 @DonnieDarkened @Trg1518 @andypowlas Amen \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe People talking about flipping tables like Jesus, as if Jesus didn\u2019t tell us to turn the other cheek.

Thank you @GatekeeperMedia !\nIn this video, Sean, Garrett, Mike and I conclude the wet and wild #discgolf doubles match at Jones Creek Park! https://t.co/kwiu00FCNY\n\u56de\u590d @ShankedDG @N8DG_ That's a talking point, for example. There's plenty more where that comes from. What I'd like to see more in the disc golf community is shying away from this, because in my experience 99.99% of the disc golfers are outside these bubbles, and I'd like to keep it that way. \ud83d\ude42\n\u56de\u590d @ShankedDG @N8DG_ @EchoDiscGolf I can't read your mind, so when you do stuff like this, I can't just intuit what you mean. Regardless, I'm glad you and Nate put things aside. I think people try to get away acting one way online, they wouldn't in person. Best of luck to you and him.\n\u56de\u590d @ShankedDG @N8DG_ The problem we get in this debate is that people immediately gravitate to the worst-case scenario. Take this for example: \"Calling trans women anything other than women invites people to take matters into their own hands, and call in further threats of violence or worse.\" Really?\nGarrett, Sean, and I team up against a challenging disc golf course in Houston called Milby Park! https://t.co/sYYcDQ7VrQ\nIn this Disc Throwdown video I play a Best Throw round of #discgolf using a new prototype midrange called the Sea Turtle, in their baseline Marine plastic, from Ocean Discs! https://t.co/g0xoQqLYhv\nIt's been 3 years since I bought my Z\u00dcCA Compact Disc Golf Cart, and I've used it extensively. In this video I tell you why I prefer to use a cart over a backpack or bag, and why I think you should buy one, too. https://t.co/Mu1mwOBXEB\n\u56de\u590d I must have watched 40+ reels and not a single disc golfer reel. I know we're a niche sport but it's amazing how easily we get replaced or deprioritized. And normally I see _some_ disc golf content. Just sharing here because I know next to nobody IRL who watches Instagram reels.\nCory and his brother Bo join Sean and I in a casual doubles round at Bear Branch Sportsfield Park, in The Woodlands, Texas!

And often it can be a way with coping with these things. Having read through Nates posts repeatedly now, I'm 100% sure you have him wrong now. Based on your arguments.\nApparently a number of top pros are playing the Las Vegas Challenge this weekend. Any post-production coverage of this event?\n\u56de\u590d @ShankedDG @N8DG_ It appears we're done with this debate, and this is fine with me. But I wanted to touch on one thing you said here. If this was actually a hoax (there's a low, but non-zero chance) the intent is likely not remotely the same. Regardless, whoever did it needs to be punished.\n\u56de\u590d @ShankedDG @N8DG_ In argumentation we call this a non sequitur. It does not follow. You're presuming support for these things just because he made a joke about the situation. Joking about something isn't support for it.\nIn this video I review Tone dual plastic technology by Clash Discs - a Finnish company trying to innovate in the disc and plastic segments of the disc golf market. https://t.co/obOE9cvrYN\n\u56de\u590d @ShankedDG @N8DG_ Well funny is subjective, and sometime it's cruel. I don't think Nate is for needlessly cruel humor that punches down. I'm not either. But I think it's a perfectly normal thing to enjoy some humor that punches down, and I'd bet money (not mine of course) he fits that bill.\n\u56de\u590d @ShankedDG @N8DG_ I disagree that you or Nate or anyone else is in a cult for having a stance on these issues. That said I think too many of these arguments are basically one extreme pitted against another. I'd like to miss that. \ud83d\ude02\n\u56de\u590d Not only is Instagram completely clueless on what I like to watch, but the Reels feature is worth even less than it normally is.
