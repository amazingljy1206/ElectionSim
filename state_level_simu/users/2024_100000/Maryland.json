Don Lemon is a complete idiot for thinking he could ask Elon about his drug use but still get a multi-millionaire dollar contract. DUMB!\nNotice the socio-economic status of all these people claiming Biden has been better than Trump.\nImagine being so racist that you are upset with a Black man playing with a White baby.\nCNN is now arguing that we should care about black on black violence to avoid \"hypocrisy\" when covering cheap shots against Caitlin Clark  Yeah, they are super jealous.\nYes, the government should try not to unnecessarily regulate the free market and should try to prevent the murder of unborn children. There is nothing hypocritical or logically inconsistent with this stance.   This wasn\u2019t what you thought it was.\nThese are the same people telling you the economy is great. They lie about everything.\nSocial Security needs to be abolished, just like federal student loans, but the GOP needs to present a REPLACEMENT that will give working people the option to retire with financial security.   Don\u2019t just take it away, make an argument for a fiscally responsible alternative.\nThe black lesbians of the WNBA are unpopular because of their attitudes, which make them poor role models for young girls, and they aren\u2019t as entertaining to watch as Caitlin Clark, not their skin color.\nAOC is always on TV. She ran as an outsider but started calling Nancy Pelosi \"Mama Bear\" after the squad got a reality check. Progressives bent the knee to the establishment while MAGA successfully executed a hostile takeover of the GOP.   Take notes.\nTrump isn\u2019t backing out of a Kamala debate but he doesn\u2019t need to agree to the Biden debate terms because he isn\u2019t debating Biden.\nI don\u2019t understand why all these people who claim America is terrible for Black people don\u2019t move to Africa.   There are less white people and the dollar will stretch much further. Take your dollars and build Wakanda in Africa. There is your reparations.\n\u56de\u590d @TheKidGravity @stori126 Because they are pointless. It\u2019s a fact that Black marriage rates are lower today than during Jim Crow. Secondly, the involvement of Black fathers in homes does not debunk the fact that a vast majority of black households are fatherless.\n\u56de\u590d @stori126 @TheKidGravity As a percentage of the total black population there are less black nuclear families today than during Jim Crow.   Your statistic is in reference to how involved Black fathers in the home are but doesn\u2019t say anything about the percentage of black fathers in homes.   Try again.\n\"A lot of these rappers are not f*cking smart\" - Cardi B  The lack of awareness is astonishing\nI could argue that the foundation of Islam is Christianity considering how it is likely the Quran was inspired by the Bible. If I ran around calling Muslims \u201cChristo-Islamists\u201d both religions would immediately reject it because they are distinctly different faiths.\nApparently Republicans believe legislation won't help secure the border, but legislation will help stop hamas attackers from crossing the border. This bill strips deportation protections for Hamas, but they won't push it for other illegals. The gaslighting is absolutely insane.\nNeither Joe Biden nor Nikki Haley are beacons of moral clarity and truth. They are the exact opposite.\nFinancial literacy needs to be a required course to graduate high school nationwide.\nI\u2019m not an undercover anything. I support the America First agenda regardless of who leads the movement.   I defend Trump against stupid attacks and Vivek against stupid attacks.  VDS &amp; TDS are equally bad. Using the Soros smear against Vivek but giving Trump a pass is PEAK VDS.\nJesus being a Jew has literally nothing to do with the fact that Judaism rejects the core doctrine of Christianity which is the divinity of Jesus.   Of course Jews and Christians share some things in common like atonement but the term Judeo-Christian is political not theological\nIf Kamala replaces Biden, Tulsi Gabbard would be the best pick, not because I agree with all her policies, but because she single-handedly ended  Kamala\u2019s Democrat primary and will expand the base.  If Trump picks her, he should propose a Presidential debate with VPs on stage.\n\u56de\u590d @keyserSoze404 Because Jim Crow was a reference to a point in time. At no point did he ever get close to stating or implying Jim Crow was a good thing.\nJoy Reid argued that black fathers were weak and helpless during Jim Crow; therefore, the Black family wasn\u2019t a good thing during the era.  Joy Reid disrespected the role of Black men and fathers, and black liberals celebrate it on behalf of white liberals. Incredible.\nIt will be interesting to see how these individuals react if/when Caitlin Clark gets seriously injured from one of these cheap shots and viewers stop watching the WNBA.  Anybody trying to justify this cheap shot on the league's literal MVP does not care about these women.\nAnybody that thinks it\u2019s a good idea to spend 1.7 trillion more dollars as the Feds move to lower internet rates while inflation is still elevated should NOT vote.\n\u56de\u590d @BTSdivision @SteveKim323 So the Black Conservative \u2018programmed\u2019 mindset lead you to believe I don\u2019t know much about finance or economics. That\u2019s a pretty silly statement because you are making assumptions based off my political beliefs. I think it\u2019s pretty clear the difference in endorsements between\u2026\nThe common denominator of Trump deranged men voting for Nikki Haley is low-testosterone.\nI\u2019ve been defending DeSantis for a long time. I defended DeSantis when Black Republicans attacked him over slavery. I rooted for DeSantis in the debate vs Gavin Newsom. I have stated numerous times I will vote for him if he is the nominee.   I support the movement as a whole.\nStephen A\u2019s \u201cpro-black\u201d handlers have gotten into his ear again. They told him that he was supporting the white girl too much. He didn\u2019t want his black card revoked again, so he pulled a Trump-deranged virtue signal to please the mob.\n\u56de\u590d @TheKidGravity I can\u2019t read his mind but it seems to be a reference to a point in time in comparison to today.
