Democrat SoS Benson is refusing to take Kennedy's name off the MI ballot. She knows that would help Trump and she's determined to stop him at all costs. Suddenly RFK is really a really important candidate to the Democrats.\nI can name several Republican candidates who challenged Trump in the 2016 primaries.  I can only think of one (by name) from this current cycle.  That feels strange to me.\nSearch algorithms and results are getting worse. There is no obvious way on Amazon to get a chronological list of an author's full book catalog. I just want to see the most recent 3-5 books and I'm wading through pages of Spanish translations and \"Editor's Picks.\" Brutal.\nIsn't that wild? I was at a friend's house and someone texted me the news. I pulled up X, my friend turned on local cable and flipped back/forth to Fox &amp; CNN. I was giving him updates and details that didn't show up on the news stations for 25-30 more minutes. It was nuts.\n\u56de\u590d @OwenGregorian Obviously not, those specific things? No. I'd have to ask my mom where she and her friends all got the idea way back when. I just know my experience, 80's/90's, it was never a left wing thing.\nGet a hypnotist.

Boomers would be giving away their banking data left and right as a result of posts like this, \"here just copy and paste all this code and see what happens!\"\n\u56de\u590d Your fight-or-flight brain can only process one thing: emotions. No logic. Pure emotion at that point. It's how heroes are born in moments of crisis. Their actions usually aren't logical.   But they *are* emotional.\nGenX largely powers the MAGA movement. (Even NPR said \"Gen X is the most Republican of the generations.\")  There's a reason for that, and there's a reason why my generation's participation in voting steadily declined until 2016.

If I'm working in a trance session with someone, I have to be attentive to their body language, breathing, facial movements, etc. Full-blown body language study is sort of its own thing, though.\n\u56de\u590d @JoshuaLisec Super Unpopular Opinion: it really never was.   How many months did it take to go from \"states have independent sovereign authority\" to \"we're sending in the military across state lines to stop the Whiskey Rebellion?\"\nWhat decade? My homeschooling experience was in the 80s/90s and it was very much a right wing Evangelical thing. Might have just been my bubble, I suppose. This is the first time I've heard someone associate it with the left wing.\nThings she mentioned in her speech last night:   - affordable housing - affordable health care  - affordable child care  - paid leave - bring down prices that are still too high (price capping)  In short: America is broke, trillions of dollars in debt, and the Democrats' big plan\u2026\n\u56de\u590d @JesseKellyDC Amen, brother. JD Vance has texted me 15 times this week. He never wants to hang out, though.\nDo we really have no right wing GenZ types on TikTok that can mirror this? Are they too busy owning the libs with facts over feelings to understand how the counter-psyop strategy works?\n\u56de\u590d @InvisibleGoril1 Yeah, I could see there being some hippie/left crossover in the 70s. I certainly saw none of that in the 80s though, not in any of the larger co-ops I spent time with.\nThe great thing? You don't have to go any great lengths to accomplish this.  I have a shade tree in my back yard. A few weeks ago, I set up a couple of nice lawn chairs and a small table under it.  My wife and I sit out there several times a week. Sunshine. Shade. Grass. No\u2026\nI'm going to have some unexpected free time this weekend. If I set aside some of that time to do one of those \"Spaces\" things (assuming I can figure it out), would that be of interest to you?\nAh yes. I still recall with fondness when Joe said, \"I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its ... the true ... rising up ... you know, the thing!\"\n\u56de\u590d @JoshuaLisec Now we're talking. Let's go down the Q rabbit hole. I've got nothing else to do.\nAnd yet people fantasize that this event will result in a Trump landslide win.  Wake up. We are a country with irreconcilable differences. If the divided response to an assassination attempt didn't make that clear, nothing will.  GO VOTE.\nI suspect it's the nicotine and not the tobacco leaf itself. I wish they'd make the distinction, because if you wanted the benefits of the nicotine without taking up a cigarette habit, you could chew the gum. Or wear the occasional patch, I suppose.\n\u56de\u590d @HotepJesus idc I still want a passport\nOr, in lots of cases, to assign those beliefs.\n\u56de\u590d Today is almost certainly going to be the best day you've had all week.

He\u2019s so far above everything we face on this earth.  Opposition will come, but Jesus has already overcame it.

I don't have to stress, strive, or worry. All I have to do is pray and speak. God performs all things for me.\nI\u2019m not for separation of church and state.

College Grad % will be higher and Blacks are by far the largest minority group.\n\u56de\u590d @Trump_2K24 @ReubenR80027912 You\u2019re assuming polling errors will be the same across different cycles?\n\u56de\u590d @ZaidJilani Trying to look at someone's past and then making predictions about what they'll do on foreign policy hasn't been reliable in the past. Nixon and China. Reagan and the USSR (in his 2nd term). Obama and the Iran deal. Eisenhower and Korea. We just don't know.\n\u56de\u590d @brianros1 What is politically dangerous for Biden is to allow his 'decency' image to be badly damaged among segments of his base + swing voters. And allowing the Gaza death toll to rise to 50-60K would have probably done that.\n\u56de\u590d @realschopenhaur @QPollsandnews That's no longer the case with the switch to Harris. But it's tricky, because Trump isn't a typical challenger, but a former President. What we don't know is whether the usual structural bias that favours the incumbent party after just one term prevails in the end.\nThe Trump number hasn't changed. The improvement for Harris comes entirely from those who were previously 'Neither'. Seems more like the Democratic base coming home rather than response bias. https://t.co/eAWloja2E5\n\u56de\u590d @KawhiStan220 @blankslate2017 Biden might win PA more convincingly than last time. But not a 5 point win.\n\u56de\u590d @brianros1 @yeselson @mjs_DC Had Dukakis won the Presidency in 1988, I'm pretty sure Wilder would have had no chance. But Bush was in the White House and the GOP couldn't quite overcome that hurdle. That's the power of structural conditions.\n\u56de\u590d @PatrickSquarep6 @EdAsante77 No, Langer would determine all of that. It's like the CBS/YouGov polls. CBS determines the weightings (which are better than other YouGov polls).\n\u56de\u590d @RaiderMatt5204 @JoelWeingart_ A lot of hyperbole I\u2019m afraid.

I\u2019m a huge fan of him. For me personally, especially as a current literary studies major, the short version is that a lot of it didn\u2019t make sense to me in terms of talking about real life situations\n\u56de\u590d @rouGhcOOkieee @ObiscureNick I mean that was (I think) supposed to be silly with it being a kids show, but I could be wrong. Definitely disturbing that Allie had to kiss a 30 year old though. Also, why did they have Alex Wolff be infatuated by an older woman? She brushed it off, but their dynamic was weird\nI\u2019ve become such a literary critic since I went back to school that it\u2019s not even funny #endwokeness\n\u56de\u590d @AdrianneCurry I feel like there\u2019s a lot of people coming out who want to create their own stuff as opposed to the woke garbage that has become Hollywood. I heard an actor say in a recent YouTube video how, for projects he puts out with his company, he wants to check boxes before creating \ud83d\ude12\nIn a world that\u2019s broken and lost with seemingly no hope, it\u2019s important to come together, put aside our differences, not harass, and turn our eyes above to the Creator who masters our destiny and knows all before we do.  \u05e9\u05d1\u05ea \u05e9\u05dc\u05d5\u05dd\n\u56de\u590d @libsoftiktok Good!

So I never really watched the Amanda Show or All That, but I knew about them to an extent. Finding out about that Penelope character\u2019s last name was one of the things that set me off the most\n\u56de\u590d @DavidBe51173507 @MinEffPodcast @Variety I believe everything. We as Christians don\u2019t go deep enough into the Bible and it drives me nuts! Yeah there are definitely things we don\u2019t support, but there are other things we shouldn\u2019t support either as I stated above\nI\u2019ll never understand the fact that grown men and women still obsess over celebrities. You can respect their work and be fans, but they\u2019re people too and you most likely don\u2019t personally know each other. Have a little respect.

Somehow I\u2019m just now seeing this. The Wiggles is supposed to be for kids. There\u2019s no reason why they need to know/learn about that kind of stuff. From what I remember, the brand was about learning and having fun. You\u2019re a boy or a girl. The non-binary stuff is just sad \ud83d\ude1e\n\u56de\u590d @KassyDillon I\u2019m actually learning the Hebrew language at my college right now.

I\u2019m sure every one of these people love the Lord and have good intentions\nSay what you want about Trump\u2019s ramblings. He seemed calmer than usual tonight, giving thanks to the Lord for his survival, talking about unity, the rally, and policy, mentioning Biden\u2019s name only briefly. It was long, but a good speech (and yes, I watched the whole thing)\n\u56de\u590d @exposingrich New York Times retracted their statement about Drake bell. Everyone involved with the case said text messages were the only problem. He took responsibility for that. So how about we stop with this\nFor everyone outraged with #QuietOnSet, we have every right to be. HOWEVER, this is a very sensitive subject! Let\u2019s not spread misinformation.

There are a lot of things the Catholic Church changed during Constantine\u2019s time, including which day the Sabbath is. I do agree it needs to be set apart though and I love the idea of Sabbath dinners!\n\u56de\u590d @JoeSoon08 @DiscussingFilm As a conservative myself, making fun of the right is nothing new to me, but that\u2019s a different story entirely. My question is why so much gore and sexual content? Is it seriously necessary? That shouldn\u2019t be just a conservative viewpoint either\n\u56de\u590d @TiaMonettelove Wow! Okay then. I\u2019m very intrigued to see how far this goes.

If you do a search online, there\u2019s many reports of evidence regarding a variety of topics related to the Bible. To the average person, it\u2019s hard to believe. I just choose to believe, especially because of stuff I\u2019ve witnessed in my own life\n\u56de\u590d @Nina7Infinity @THR As a literary studies major who wants to publish books, I agree\n\u56de\u590d @nosoup4knowles There\u2019s Boys Scouts and then there\u2019s Girls Scouts. I like Scouting America if they\u2019re combining two organizations, but still keep the two groups themselves separate\n\u56de\u590d @ugwueke02 @alexanikolas__ I mean no one\u2019s said anything about what went on with that scene, but the episode premiered in the beginning of 2009.

You do the math and \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\u56de\u590d @MrStillwater @MinEffPodcast @Variety Actually a movie would\u2019ve been interesting! And I\u2019m a Torah believer. Short story is that I have maybe a little Jewish ancestry in me and I believe that Christians don\u2019t go deep enough into the Bible. In regards to this subject, I don\u2019t agree with homosexuality\n\u56de\u590d @MissJezebel76 I don\u2019t like Supernatural because of my faith, but as an aspiring writer, I can appreciate things about it. The finale was a neat epilogue to complete the whole series. Not sure of other tweets Jim tweeted, but I did see some where I knew he was joking. People need to get a grip\nHow about we as conservatives actually come together to fight the culture war and stop believing everything we read or hear in the news? \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\u56de\u590d @KassyAkiva @JeremyDBoreing They didn\u2019t say it was going to be live streamed, but they should\u2019ve at least said it wouldn\u2019t be\n\u56de\u590d @aj_richmo @mjeanae I had to force myself to read the charges because they kind of went over my head before.

Is it possible for a game with romance options to have one of the options be yourself? Like taking the narcissistic route to the max being in love with yourself so much that you romance yourself.

But i have to make a note to myself to not eat a meal again while watching the show, just finished watching the living armor episode and yeah i feel sick lol.\nOn another note with Star Wars Outlaws i gotta give a huge shoutout to Massive Entertainment. I remember months ago one of the devs said the game wasn't going to be a giant bloated open world and yeah their totally right.

Trump is back as frontrunner.\n\u56de\u590d @Wendys_Garden Country would be cool with two women IMO.  In fact it would be exciting and appealing on balance.

Harris would be cagey to support a competition.\n\u56de\u590d @skrossa @NGrossman81 @sydrasmith You think politicians publicly supporting their party leader is a \"conspiracy\" and \"lying to voters\" if they privately have deep misgivings?  Their job is to advocate for the party leader.  That's politics.    They can differ on issues.\n\u56de\u590d @magi_jay The Repubs will easily portray Biden as feeble AFTER he secures the nomination.   The plan to make the election about Trump is not happening post debate.  There is nothing gained by sticking head in sand.  Biden must be replaced.  BTW, state polling is awful.  ignore national.\n\u56de\u590d @DamonLinker @NGrossman81 I am in deep despair.  Walz's branding plays perfectly into the GOP gameplan.

Biden is pathetic in his current state and trending worse.    The polls in swing states are clear.  It doesn't matter how you and I view the candidates.\n\u56de\u590d @IAmSophiaNelson I think two women would generate excitement that overcomes any backlash.  I honestly don;t think we need to set ANY preconditions on the gender/race of either half of the ticket.

I didn't react to what Bremmer said as an attempt to praise Trump.  Trump's core skill is as a weathervane.  If he is making noises about wrapping up the war, that reflects something in the air.  Trump can't be nailed down, he's empty vessel.\n\u56de\u590d @RIOldFolksHome @RadioFreeTom McCarthy blocked aid and initiated the tie to solving immigration &amp; finding a cure for cancer first.

The premise Philip presented about Biden's culpability is political hackery.  I'm hawkish on the need to crush hamas. The choice is not between following Bebe's plan &amp; surrendering.\n\u56de\u590d @skrossa @NGrossman81 @sydrasmith I assume they are politicians who can assess evidence from polls and focus groups.\n\u56de\u590d @ByronYork \"Democratic prosecutor\"?   Only half of our justice system counts as legitimate?\n\u56de\u590d @skrossa @NGrossman81 @sydrasmith I'm old and wheelchair bound.    I have no issue with disability in most jobs.    As far as age, it matters to the presidency &amp; Supreme Court nominees.    Putting age min &amp; max is reasonable bow to life's realities.  Biden's past performance is debatable &amp; irrelevant.\n\u56de\u590d @Shermichael_ Since Mike Johnson was confirmed by 100% of the Republican caucus, the argument that it was just a handful of trouble makers is not credible.  The dysfunction and unprincipled selfishness runs deep.  I doubt McCarthy would have bucked Trump either.\n\u56de\u590d @skrossa @NGrossman81 @sydrasmith The point is that he is running to serve to be an 86-year-old president.   I assumed you could make that leap.   Your point about incumbent coronation is generally true, and it refutes your contradicting assertion that such a faux primary = expression of voter  sentiment.\n\u56de\u590d @Christo77309767 @NGrossman81 When it comes to the Presidency, ageism was, is and always will be a wise idea.  Organizations don't hire very old or young ppl to manage their businesses.   Sound reasoning for both.\n\u56de\u590d @least4masks @wisconsin_now Majorities and later supermajorities of Dems wanted Biden to step down.  The pressure campaign reflected public opinion.
