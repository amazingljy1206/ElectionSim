This happens in countries w/ abortion bans. Women who need care get harmed or die. This is the unintended consequence of the prolife movement.\n\u56de\u590d @tuna_neck @the_blind_guide @breaking_idols Innocent people often suffer bec of the sins of others. The fact that her child died isn\u2019t an indication of her guilt. As others here have said, scripture paints David, and only David, as the guilty party.\n\u56de\u590d @StMosesPress @flyingnone2 @arlenparsa I\u2019m a retired L&amp;D RN. I know what a fetus is and why criminalizing abortion will kill innocent women. An anti-abortion woman who founded a clinic for disadvantaged women once said that she opposes the pro-life movement bec there\u2019s too much injustice in it. Sit with that thought.\n\u56de\u590d @TakeWeightOffMD @Sheep_in_fog @1ConciergeMed Do you have any recs for some kind of PrEP for those who need dental work or surgery?\n\u56de\u590d @CarlAilara @bonhoefferchild Oh, they\u2019ll decrease if the most rabid Republicans get their way.

And, very often, it still requires delivery before viability. No one is trying to kill wanted babies here. But good doctors know that sometimes they just can\u2019t safely wait for that fetus to mature. Courts shouldn\u2019t decide that.\n\u56de\u590d @PaulRKeeble Well, it has sedative properties so\u2026but one thing I\u2019ve noticed is that I\u2019m more likely to get bradycardia from a med when my thyroid hormone levels are low. Are you having any sx of low thyroid? I know it\u2019s less common in men.\n\u56de\u590d @TheRyanHamilton This was so moving. I hope the average prolife voter seeing this is also moved and reconsiders their support of laws designed to harm and intimidate. Praying for you and your wife.\n\u56de\u590d @elle_carnitine I think the poster is claiming that it\u2019s a psych issue for which we get positive reinforcement (2nd post). You know, the usual BPS crap whereby if we strengthen the mind, we strengthen the body. \ud83d\ude44\n\u56de\u590d @subversivepsych Up to 1800 mg, I think. Starting slow and gradually titrating to effect. Some are using other forms (more effective, more side effects) like benfotiamine. Doses are diff, depending on type of thiamine. Might need Mg+ and K+ supplementation to decr adverse effects.\n\u56de\u590d @gwmoyski95 I didn\u2019t say that. I said the law omits safeguarding maternal health. That part about organs? Yeah, it puts an undue burden of proof on the physician. It creates limitations re maternal wellbeing. It\u2019s no longer up to the doc to decide what\u2019s legal. It\u2019s up to Ken Paxton.\n\u56de\u590d @BFriedmanDC \ud83d\ude06 Reminds me of the time one of the elderly nurses bought new key rings for the med cart keys (yes, old style drug security) and they were actually leaf-decorated roach stones w/ roach clips. Clueless!\n\u56de\u590d @gwmoyski95 Here\u2019s a link. It\u2019s also in the Washington Post but possibly behind a paywall. But they\u2019re all over the news. https://t.co/hQKyXTMjsC\n\u56de\u590d @irishital1035 @TraumaSoapBoxes Mike, OB was my field for 38 years. I\u2019m a retired L&amp;D nurse. Part of my job was making sure RNs followed the law. I also tracked stats for our unit. An AB is defined by gestational age and/or weight, not by procedure. An early C/S is actually called a hysterotomy but it\u2019s -&gt;\n\u56de\u590d @MattyCholo @lucyveepee Matty, we\u2019ve known it\u2019s vascular since just a few months in\u2014way before vaccines were available. It enters thru your respiratory system but it spreads everywhere you have blood vessels, causing endothelial and organ damage.\n\u56de\u590d @_diatoma Oh, Maria! I was listening to Piazolla yesterday and had to restrain myself just to hand movements (I never danced tango, just enjoyed moving to the music). ME and LC cause so much loss! I hope you return to baseline soon.\n\u56de\u590d @Tara2911 @cdtwriter I\u2019ve been watching the temps from afar (love MX, esp Oaxaca) and this is the first time I\u2019ve consistently seen higher temps in Oaxaca City than in Puerto Escondido. Just wild. Hope you manage to find some \ud83c\udd92.\n\u56de\u590d @Lookingtooclose @WindsorONAntifa @alitlstrawberry Chad, I detect no science in your claim.\n\u56de\u590d @subversivepsych @ChanatLucine It looks like a lot of docs say there\u2019s no evidence of B1\u2019s efficacy for Parkinson\u2019s but you know people w/ ME and LC will try almost anything. I\u2019m not sure how high the B1 dose should be for ME/LC (still reading) but @JeffLubell_C19 has survey results on the Health Rising blog.\n\u56de\u590d @gwmoyski95 It\u2019s irrelevant that the law was misapplied. The law was designed to intimidate. This is the result of that intimidation. You could blame the doc if this was rare. It\u2019s not rare. It\u2019s the law that\u2019s the problem.\n\u56de\u590d @StMosesPress @flyingnone2 @arlenparsa and nurses. Republicans don\u2019t want to give social supports to reduce ABs. Support is too much like socialism for them. Look at the R party now. It favors oppressive authoritarianism. That\u2019s how it plans to stop abortion. Odd, tho. That\u2019ll fail. See Ceausescu\u2019s Romania.\n\u56de\u590d @Starseeker1986 I would prob pass a tilt table test in the AM. But I\u2019d fail it in the afternoon. I think the reason my HR is stable in the AM is rt the Pepcid I take at night. Sounds like the cardio doesn\u2019t know that a lot of things can affect results . I hope you do get a correct diagnosis.\n\u56de\u590d @cdtwriter No we didn\u2019t. I just mean that, since I can do very little about the world going to hell, I can at least enjoy the pleasures remaining: a nice cup of coffee, birds singing, etc. Because soon, very soon I think, there\u2019ll be no affordable coffee and no birds singing. It\u2019s tragic.\n\u56de\u590d @gwmoyski95 I think it\u2019s difficult for prolife people to see the unintended consequences of their decision to criminalize abortion despite the fact that there\u2019s a mountain of evidence against it\n\u56de\u590d @MattyCholo @lucyveepee Drs on the front lines and scientists informed us. Are the lungs an organ? Yes, they are. Pneumonia and cytokine storms killed in the acute phase. That doesn\u2019t negate the fact that there is massive vascular infiltration and damage.

Its not worth it.\n\u56de\u590d @cockamaymee @rebels2008 @GalenMetzger1 Most of the people coming into texas are muc more diverse and educated than the general population, thats a myth. I think the hispanic population will hold dems from getting it in 2024, but it is NOT a right trending state. It even trended left in 2022 with no minority turnout\n\u56de\u590d @rebels2008 @cockamaymee @GalenMetzger1 This is not true. Hispanics are littered across most of Texas, rural/small town Hispanics are super duper republican in texas. Inner city low ed Houston will probably continue to swing right massively. The rest though yeah dems will hold\n\u56de\u590d @IiiVindman @gelliottmorris The issue with me isnt the fact that theres slippage, but the magnitude of slippage that these pollsters are reporting. There was a high quality nationwide poll with biden +1 as the headlines that had reasonable crosstabs, biden -12 with seniors and biden +28 with young voters.\n\u56de\u590d @ADowling34 @DjsokeSpeaking @argdent There is no conservative migration from the west coast into texas. That is a complete myth birthed by 1 shitty 2018 exit poll. The migration into texas is more than 50% non-white and is vastly more college educated than the nation.\n\u56de\u590d @PoliticalKiwi Assuming theres some movement in AZ in the white phoenix suburbs towards Joe Biden, and there isn't some catastrophic collapse that is any bigger than 2020 with latino voters, then how exactly does Donald Trump win AZ?Pima and Maricopa swung 5% to the left in spite of hispanics\n\u56de\u590d @schlagteslinks I am pretty highly skeptical of the up incoming young and black trumpian surge, but I do think republicans are going to make real in roads with hispanics(again) in 2024. I think they will shift ~15-20% rightward and theres real evidence besides just recent presidential polling.\n\u56de\u590d @CautiousLefty Because biden is a decently worse candidate than 2020, mainly due to food and gas prices and inflation and stuff. More anti-biden sentiment, trumps the alternative.\n\u56de\u590d @GalenMetzger1 Texas is likely R. More or less the same swings as 2020.

Thats when a bunch of missing question marks get plugged in, and most of the eventful things are over with. If Biden isnt improving, trump is favored. If hes improving, then we'll see. If hes *vastly improving, he probably won.\n\u56de\u590d @ahshhshddbb A third of bucks is white working class voters in the southern portion. The rest is college educated suburbs go brrrrr hail emperor Joe biden.\n\u56de\u590d @schlagteslinks It's almost impossible to draw a trump win if those conditions are met. The rest of the state would need to massively shift rightward to overcome a very small shift in some very urban dem-trending areas where dems have been doing well as of late.\n\u56de\u590d @PoliticalKiwi @lxeagle17 Do you think wisconsin will be joe bidens strongest swing state relative to 2020? Its the most white, and relatively secular of them all.\n\u56de\u590d @Ed_of_O @PoliticalKiwi Nevada is mostly clark county. Clark trended right 3 times in a row, and Biden didn't win it in 2020 by nearly the amount I thought he would. Clark county is decently diverse, decently low education, heavy hispanic county.

Arrests, teenage pregnancy, public sex acts\n\u56de\u590d @DefiyantlyFree Actually, Mar-a-Lago probably can\u2019t sell for 100s of millions. See it\u2019s a club, a business, its value is inherent in it n revenue and upkeep (which is expensive). It\u2019s basically permanently protected from development so you\u2019re stuck.\nHey @AtriumHealth, remember when you gave thousands to @danbishopnc and he went the the legislature and spearheaded HB2!?!?  @wsoctv @WBTV_News   https://t.co/Wm0dbQVF9A\n\u56de\u590d @Mashburn4NC @tamera_christie is correct. CRT has never been part of NC curriculum. We\u2019ve had 2 GOP superintendents in a row. You have not \u201cvisited classrooms\u201d I assure you that. This is no longer about \u201cthe children\u201d but it\u2019s about Christian nationalism.\nThat\u2019s not what it said, it said it needs more detail and he gave Fani six months to resubmit. He actually said there is an ABUNDANCE of evidence but more detail is needed for the defense to properly defend.\n\u56de\u590d @GW_bodyguard @Mashburn4NC Oh shit you got me. Outlawing men in women\u2019s bathrooms would have stopped. More funding for rape kits? Nope! Mental health? Fuck off!  I KNOW don\u2019t allow men in women\u2019s restrooms! If a man drove a red truck and raped a girl, are we going to ban men from red trucks too!\n\u56de\u590d @TrumpDailyPosts @CommunityNotes Victor Orban is a dictator. Hungry has rigged elections, out of control inflation, and severe humans rights issues.\n\u56de\u590d @shadowban_fix @LoriLoriLori123 @KenPaxtonTX So you\u2019re okay with him wasting taxpayer money, to stop the spending of taxpayer money that you know he can\u2019t stop? Brilliant.  The truth is he really wants to halt the amendment affording federal protections to pregnant women.

He tweets at conspiracy theorist felons like Gen. Flynn and accepts their praise. His rise to power was funded by @AtriumHealth, their PAC and executives, yet mums the word on they approve!?\n\u56de\u590d @Mashburn4NC Weird, I\u2019ve never raped anyone, lied to increase my net worth by billions, paid of a porn star, or tried to illegally change the results of an election.  How are they coming after me again?\n\u56de\u590d @MargoinWNC @BrentWoodcox I do enjoy his names, Large Marge.   Do you think he\u2019d like it? https://t.co/bWRegR3N33\n\u56de\u590d @GudTroubl2 @CournanJane That makes zero sense, it\u2019s always been a federal program administered though private or state entities.
